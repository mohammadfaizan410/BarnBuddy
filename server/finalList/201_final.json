      "description": "Warlock is a storied award winning indica-dominant strain (85:15) that was derived through purposeful breeding and backcrossing classic strains of Skunk #1 and Afghani to extract favourable genetic traits.

This magical strain achieves a high-THC level with a terpene profile that includes Caryophyllene, Myrcene, and Limonene.",

Itâs just what youâd expect from the name, with bold citrus and diesel flavours thanks to terpinolene, limonene, caryophyllene and beta-pinene terpenes. This sativa-dominant hybrid strainâs signature sour taste has hints of lemon and orange. This potent phenotype even looks sour, with frosty, pale green buds that glitter with trichomes. \n\nTHC: 18-25%\nCBD: <1%",
