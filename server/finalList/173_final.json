It stays true to its colorful lineage and produces dense green flowers that are streaked with purples and blues, and sometimes pinks and oranges. Purple Berry gives off a sweet smell with just a hint of nuttiness; the taste follows suit with an overwhelmingly blueberry flavor. Though a strain with heavy effects, many consumers report that it is less sedative and allows for some mental alertness while providing a strong body buzz.",

      "strainDescription": "Alien Kush is a potent cross of LVPK and Alien Dawg that originally hails from California, not deep space. It may have you feeling a little spacey, though, as this strain touches down in the brain first, giving active, sometimes-psychedelic effects. The active buzz settles over time into a relaxing body buzz that will dissolve both stress and pain. Alien Kush plants have average yields, but they are hardy, easy-to-grow plants, indoors or out. The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

The active buzz settles over time into a relaxing body buzz that will dissolve both stress and pain. Alien Kush plants have average yields, but they are hardy, easy-to-grow plants, indoors or out. The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

Purple Berry gives off a sweet smell with just a hint of nuttiness; the taste follows suit with an overwhelmingly blueberry flavor. Though a strain with heavy effects, many consumers report that it is less sedative and allows for some mental alertness while providing a strong body buzz.",

The active buzz settles over time into a relaxing body buzz that will dissolve both stress and pain. Alien Kush plants have average yields, but they are hardy, easy-to-grow plants, indoors or out. The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

It stays true to its colorful lineage and produces dense green flowers that are streaked with purples and blues, and sometimes pinks and oranges. Purple Berry gives off a sweet smell with just a hint of nuttiness; the taste follows suit with an overwhelmingly blueberry flavor. Though a strain with heavy effects, many consumers report that it is less sedative and allows for some mental alertness while providing a strong body buzz.",

The active buzz settles over time into a relaxing body buzz that will dissolve both stress and pain. Alien Kush plants have average yields, but they are hardy, easy-to-grow plants, indoors or out. The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.",

Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",
