The flower is compact, light green in color, and generally covered in orange hairs. Huckleberry plants have a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and produce average yields. They might be a bit tricky for the novice grower. The effects of this strain are on the milder side and largely reported as relaxing, cutting through stress without the cloudiness. Undoubtedly, this strain is best known for its intense fruity smell and taste, similar to its relative Blueberry.",

Blue dream is 18% THC but has a low CBD percentage, making this potent strain a fan favorite of both novice and veteran cannabis consumers. In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

This strain is beloved by many consumers for its energizing effects. But don’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",

      "description": "A little treat before bed is never a bad thing, and if you enjoy strains that mellow you out in the best way possible, Purple Animal Cookies might be right up your alley. Said to be bred by CannaVenture Seeds, this low profile strain is a cross between Animal Cookies and LVPK. Her Cookie genetics shine through beautifully, making her a must-try for recreational and medical users alike.\n\nThere’s a fair bit of mystery that surrounds Purple Animal Cookies, and narrowing down her potency is just the tip of the iceberg. Many will describe that these beautifully colored nugs offer a strong high, so we’d guess that she’s near, if not exceeds, the 20% mark. Although her moniker would lead one to believe that her flavors and aromas are intensely sweet, this note only comes through a little bit and blends with earth and trees for a balanced experience. While many indica-dominant hybrids are great at imparting feelings of relaxation, Purple Animal Cookies takes that concept to another level. Right off the bat, users will notice every muscle in their body softening and as you sink into sedation, your mood will soar. Happiness runs through you from head to toe and while you won’t necessarily feel the need to shout it from the rooftops, you and your couch will know that euphoria is alive and well. Prepare to fall asleep with this strain, especially if you continue to enjoy her throughout the evening. Individuals who struggle with depression and anxiety are often looking for ways to get happy and stay there, making Purple Animal Cookies an ideal option. Not only is this bud great for addressing mental woes but you can count on her to help with a wide range of physical issues too. Relaxation is so prevalent that nearly any type of physical pain will be subdued, including migraines, symptoms of arthritis, and more. Again, depending on how large of a dose you choose, this strain can offer significantly strong effects. Assuming you can locate this bud at your neighborhood dispensary, Purple Animal Cookies might easily become one of your new favorite strains. Clear your calendar, grab a blanket, and pace yourself with this intensely sedating gal - no matter what happened during the day, you’ll be able to wipe the slate clean and fall asleep with a smile on your face.",

      "description": "The balanced hybrid known as White Runtz is a favorite of Runtz fans, fans of citrus, and anyone who craves stress relief. Like most Runtz strains, it has Gelato and Zkittlez in its genetic lineage, the results, in this case, being creamy, sleepy, fruity, and a bag of giggles. The long-lasting experience of enjoying White Runtz is enjoyed by most who can find it, though it remains a bit of an exclusive offering by the Cookies growers out of California. It’s so good that Runtz has pretty much locked down the sale of seeds. But if you can find the buds, you’re in for a treat. The plant grows large, thick nugs shaped like spades. They’re deep green with frosty crystal trichomes and thin amber hairs. White Runtz offers tropical fruit and sweet cream flavors. Some consumers say it reminds them of ice cream. While smoking the strain, hints of diesel arise. White Runtz’s effect is a calming, tingly sense of relaxation. It starts traveling up your back, up to your neck, and then proceeds to relax your whole body. This makes the strain perfect for watching movies, going to a spa and getting a massage, or doing nothing at all. The flavor is full of notes of tropical citrus, earth, and sweet cream. It’s a major kick-back that gives you the chance to enjoy your evening by feeling creative and relaxed without having to contend with your normal dose of stress and anxiety.\n\nWhite Runtz is a particular favorite for sufferers of chronic pain conditions due to its ability to relieve muscle cramps and spasms. Chronic issues related to back pain, menstrual issues, arthritis, and more can be helped by relieving muscle tension using a dose of White Runtz. The bonus is that you’ll get to see what all the fuss is about with the famous tropical cream and fruity earth flavors. You may not be able to grow it for yourself, but if you go to the source, you’ll be able to learn its secrets.",

Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

      "strainDescription": "Chemdawg, officially named \"Chemdog,\" is a hybrid marijuana strain grown and spread by the breeder Chemdog since 1991. In a Leafly interview, Chemdog relates how Chemdog came from what was thought to be Northern California bag seed, via a Colorado Grateful Dead concert. Chem 91, Chem 4, and Chem Sis are all variations on Chemdog. The original name Chemdog came from two names for the same bud \"Chem\" and \"Dog bud.\" Chemdog evolved into the variation 'Chemdawg' over time and distance as other growers and breeders propagated it, with the latter name becoming more dominant. Leafly customers tell us Chemdawg effects include feeling euphoric, uplifted, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose Chemdawg when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Chemdog is a staple strain in cannabis and may be a source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdog is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, you’ll be able to smell this strain from a mile away. Cannabis newbies be warned: Chemdog tends to be very potent. Consumers can expect to have a cerebral experience, coupled with a strong heavy-bodied feeling. ",

Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",
