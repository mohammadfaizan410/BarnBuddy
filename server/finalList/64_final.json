      "strainDescription": "Phantom Cookies, also known as \"Phantom Cookie,\" is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain from Northern California that crosses a flavorful Cherry Pie with the resin-heavy Granddaddy Purple. Green and purple hues weave through the buds beneath a crystalline layer of trichomes, from which sprout Phantom Cookies’ electric orange hairs. Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

      "strainDescription": "Gelato, also known as \"Larry Bird\" and \"Gelato #42\" is an evenly-balanced hybrid marijuana strain made from a crossing of Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies. With its balance of indica &amp; sativa, this strain produces a euphoric high accompanied by strong feelings of relaxation. Consumers who have smoked Gelato say the effects of the strain come on quickly. You'll be left feeling numb to pain, relaxed, but mentally stimulated and productive. As far as potency goes, Gelato boasts a THC level of 21%, making it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief for pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high THC tolerance will delight in the heavy-handed effects this strain offers. In terms of taste, Gelato is sweet and features fruity and creamy flavors and aromas. According to growers, this strain produces buds that bloom in dark purple hues and are illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shiny white coating of crystal resin. The average price per gram of Gelato is $12. Because Gelato has reached a legendary status among cannabis connoisseurs, it comes as no surprise it's been used to make a variety of other high-quality Gelato strains, including Gelato #3, Gelato #33, Gelato #41, and Gelato #45.",

      "description": "The balanced hybrid known as White Runtz is a favorite of Runtz fans, fans of citrus, and anyone who craves stress relief. Like most Runtz strains, it has Gelato and Zkittlez in its genetic lineage, the results, in this case, being creamy, sleepy, fruity, and a bag of giggles. The long-lasting experience of enjoying White Runtz is enjoyed by most who can find it, though it remains a bit of an exclusive offering by the Cookies growers out of California. It’s so good that Runtz has pretty much locked down the sale of seeds. But if you can find the buds, you’re in for a treat. The plant grows large, thick nugs shaped like spades. They’re deep green with frosty crystal trichomes and thin amber hairs. White Runtz offers tropical fruit and sweet cream flavors. Some consumers say it reminds them of ice cream. While smoking the strain, hints of diesel arise. White Runtz’s effect is a calming, tingly sense of relaxation. It starts traveling up your back, up to your neck, and then proceeds to relax your whole body. This makes the strain perfect for watching movies, going to a spa and getting a massage, or doing nothing at all. The flavor is full of notes of tropical citrus, earth, and sweet cream. It’s a major kick-back that gives you the chance to enjoy your evening by feeling creative and relaxed without having to contend with your normal dose of stress and anxiety.\n\nWhite Runtz is a particular favorite for sufferers of chronic pain conditions due to its ability to relieve muscle cramps and spasms. Chronic issues related to back pain, menstrual issues, arthritis, and more can be helped by relieving muscle tension using a dose of White Runtz. The bonus is that you’ll get to see what all the fuss is about with the famous tropical cream and fruity earth flavors. You may not be able to grow it for yourself, but if you go to the source, you’ll be able to learn its secrets.",

      "description": "Tangieland is a cute strain with a cute name, rare and evenly balanced between Indica and Sativa. The flavor is addictingly delicious despite coming with a pretty sour flavor. This is a strain for those who love citrus flavors, spicy herbs, and the taste of sweet earth. The high is incredible and the soothing effects come not only with mood improvements but also reduced inflammation.\n\nA few hits in, Tangieland becomes a place where you can experience renewed creative energy (and reduced pain). If you have art projects or writing you need to finish, Tangieland can provide a welcome escape from the grind, calm down your stress, and treat chronic conditions. The plant itself has unique arrowhead-like nugs with soft, almost invisible amber trichomes. It was bred by Crockett Family Farms as a cross between Tangie and Candyland, reasonably enough. The result inherits flavors from both sides of the family. The overwhelming flavor at first is of a soft, sugary candy with the zing of a citrus tang flavor and the scent of pine trees. There’s an overtone of herbal spiciness as well that increases as the nugs are burned, turning into an earthy, outdoorsy haze. That’s when the creative energy kicks in. You won’t be sinking and sleeping in Tangieland – you’ll be bouncing off your couch and ready to put in the creativity to get your day started. That’s why we recommend trips to Tangieland during the daytime only, time when you can be aware of the tingly relaxation, the pain relief, and the alertness. The effects most effectively treated with Tangieland include chronic pain, depression, inflammation, spasms, and fatigue. If you find that your work gives you headaches or migraines in the evening, probably accompanied by fatigue, Tangieland can help you. The classic tingling energy of this balanced strain encourages a sense of clear-headed awareness and focus. You’ll feel cerebral and introspective, ready to tackle your day with a more unified self.\n\nThe effects of Tangieland are uplifting and the flavors help with that. The candied orange, sweet herbs, and earth flavors would make anyone feel great, even if they aren’t used to intense cannabis strains. Reaching THC levels up to 20%, Tangieland isn’t a record-breaker or a slump either. It’ll get the job done, no matter your experience level. It’s easy to remember Tangieland’s name once you focus on the candy flavors and citrus sweetness. If you use it, you’ll remember the sense of cerebral, creative calm even more. ",

This strain is beloved by many consumers for its energizing effects. But don’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",

Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

This strain is beloved by many consumers for its energizing effects. But don’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",

Lime Sorbet produces pleasant feelings of relaxation while subduing both anxiety and stress. In terms of flavor, Lime Sorbet offers a pungent and earthy aroma mixed with the tart flavor of fresh lime. Medical marijuana patients often choose Lime Sorbet to relieve symptoms associated with chronic pain, mental stress, and anxiety. This strain is known to produce dry mouth when smoked in large quantities, so it's best to stay hydrated while you partake. According to growers, Lime Sorbet flowers into fluffy buds with light olive green foliage, thick white trichomes, and fire orange hairs throughout. This strain was originally bred by Cresco Labs.",
