Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing  Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

      "description": "Doggy Bag is also known as “The Doggy Bag”, is a 60/40 indica dominant hybrid. This strain was made by crossing Zkittlez and Project 4516. This bud has a sweet and flowery rose candy flavor with a spicy diesel exhale. The aroma is very similar, with a spicy diesel overtone accented by flowery chemicals and a punch of heavy gas. Snoop Dogg has called this strain “the breakfast of champions” because it is said to provide an equally relaxing and rejuvenating high with balanced head/body high. \nDried cannabis flower is primarily ingested via inhalation. Activation time is roughly about 5 minutes and can last up to a few hours.",

      "description": "Since the arrival of this unknown and once unnamed cultivar at Funk Farm, much discussion has taken place as to what the possible genetics of this particular cut are.  One thing is for sure: it is most definitely a descendant of Gelato.  Its beautiful colors and gorgeous shining trichomes provide a bag appeal on par with the prettiest of strains.  Earthy, sweet, and very slightly piney gelato notes are met with a sour hint as well as a more subtle sugary, sour candy terpene.  The flavor is almost reminiscent of a Runtz strain with a stronger emphasis on the Gelato profile.  The effects are heavy hitting and relaxing making this an excellent option for overly stressed or high-anxiety individuals. \n\n\nGenetics: Unknown",

Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us it’s a smooth smoke that tastes earthy, floral, and woody. Horchata effects are uplifting and relaxing. Some consumers say this strain makes them extra talkative. Medical marijuana patients choose Horchata to relieve symptoms associated with PTSD and depression. The dominant terpene in this strain is myrcene, with pinene and ocimene as the secondary terpenes. Horchata is 19% THC, although actual THC percentage may vary from grower to grower. This strain pairs well with evening activities but could also be used for stimulating conversation among friends. The popular Horchata in 2022 comes from Compound Genetics, though WyEast Genetics also sells crosses of it.",
