      "strainDescription": "Green Gelato is an indica-dominant hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies and Sunset Sherbet. This strain is 40% sativa and 60% indica. Green Gelato has a rare and exotic lineage, as it is the only strain cultivated by Grow West in Maryland. Green Gelato is 18-22% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for experienced cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us Green Gelato effects include feeling relaxed, happy, and euphoric. Medical marijuana patients often choose Green Gelato when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and pain. Bred by Royal Queen Seeds, Green Gelato features flavors like grape, citrus, and mint. The dominant terpene of this strain is myrcene, which contributes to its sedating and anti-inflammatory properties. The average price of Green Gelato typically ranges from $10-$15 per gram. Green Gelato is a deliciously purple strain with dense, resin-coated buds that burst with fruity flavor. This strain is great for treating yourself to a sweet and creamy smoke that coats the mouth and soothes the body. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed Green Gelato, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

      "strainDescription": "Skywalker is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that is renowned for its potent effects and distinct aroma. It typically has a THC percentage ranging from 15% to 23%, with low levels of CBD. The top effects of Skywalker include a deep relaxation and euphoria. It is an excellent choice for stress relief, pain management, and insomnia. The top flavors and aromas of Skywalker are earthy, woody, and spicy, with hints of sweetness and fruitiness. The dominant terpene in Skywalker is caryophyllene, which has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The Skywalker weed strain has become popular among cannabis enthusiasts, and many people wonder if it has any connection to the Star Wars franchise. While the strain's name likely refers to the characters in the Star Wars universe, there is no official connection between the two. However, it's interesting to note that both the strain and the franchise are widely known and loved, and they share a name that adds to their mystique and popularity. So, while you won't find Luke Skywalker smoking Skywalker weed in any of the Star Wars movies, it's still fun to speculate about the potential connection between the two. ",

This strain was originally bred by Mr. Sherbinski, who bred Sherbert intentionally to inherit the genetic lineage of its parent strain Girl Scout Cookies.",

      "strainDescription": "Chemdawg, officially named \"Chemdog,\" is a hybrid marijuana strain grown and spread by the breeder Chemdog since 1991. In a Leafly interview, Chemdog relates how Chemdog came from what was thought to be Northern California bag seed, via a Colorado Grateful Dead concert. Chem 91, Chem 4, and Chem Sis are all variations on Chemdog. The original name Chemdog came from two names for the same bud \"Chem\" and \"Dog bud.\" Chemdog evolved into the variation 'Chemdawg' over time and distance as other growers and breeders propagated it, with the latter name becoming more dominant. Leafly customers tell us Chemdawg effects include feeling euphoric, uplifted, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose Chemdawg when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Chemdog is a staple strain in cannabis and may be a source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdog is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, you’ll be able to smell this strain from a mile away. Cannabis newbies be warned: Chemdog tends to be very potent. Consumers can expect to have a cerebral experience, coupled with a strong heavy-bodied feeling. ",

This strain produces calming effects that are mentally relaxing, but make you feel physically tingly. Black Cherry Punch is not recommended for consumers with a low THC tolerance, as the potency of this strain generally hovers around 20%. Descending from a dessert strain, you can expect a loud flavor profile full of sweet cherry flavors and floral undertones. Medical marijuana patients choose Black Cherry Punch to help relieve symptoms associated with chronic stress, chronic pain, insomnia and depression. If you've smoked, dabbed or consumed Black Cherry Punch, tell us about your experience by leaving a review.",

This strain features a robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers. Those with a low THC tolerance should take it slow with GSC as the effects of the strain may be overwhelming. The high THC content in GSC is beloved by medical marijuana patients looking for quick relief from symptoms associated with chronic pain, nausea, and appetite loss. GSC is famous for its pungent, dessert-like aroma &amp; flavor profile featuring bold notes of mint, sweet cherry, and lemon. The average price per gram of GSC is $11. This strain has won numerous accolades and awards over the years, including a few Cannabis Cups. Because GSC has reached legendary status among the cannabis community at large, you can find many variations of this sought-after strain, including Thin Mint (aka Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies) and Platinum GSC (aka Platinum Girl Scout Cookies).",

This strain features a robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers. Those with a low THC tolerance should take it slow with GSC as the effects of the strain may be overwhelming. The high THC content in GSC is beloved by medical marijuana patients looking for quick relief from symptoms associated with chronic pain, nausea, and appetite loss. GSC is famous for its pungent, dessert-like aroma &amp; flavor profile featuring bold notes of mint, sweet cherry, and lemon. The average price per gram of GSC is $11. This strain has won numerous accolades and awards over the years, including a few Cannabis Cups. Because GSC has reached legendary status among the cannabis community at large, you can find many variations of this sought-after strain, including Thin Mint (aka Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies) and Platinum GSC (aka Platinum Girl Scout Cookies).",

This strain features a robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers. Those with a low THC tolerance should take it slow with GSC as the effects of the strain may be overwhelming. The high THC content in GSC is beloved by medical marijuana patients looking for quick relief from symptoms associated with chronic pain, nausea, and appetite loss. GSC is famous for its pungent, dessert-like aroma &amp; flavor profile featuring bold notes of mint, sweet cherry, and lemon. The average price per gram of GSC is $11. This strain has won numerous accolades and awards over the years, including a few Cannabis Cups. Because GSC has reached legendary status among the cannabis community at large, you can find many variations of this sought-after strain, including Thin Mint (aka Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies) and Platinum GSC (aka Platinum Girl Scout Cookies).",
