      "strainDescription": "Garlic Bud is a classic indica strain from the 90's, bred by The Seed Bank (now known as Sensi Seeds) using Afghani genetics. Its name is only loosely tied to Garlic Bud's aroma, which smells a lot more like tangy musk and spice than anything you'd throw in your stir fry. This pungent-smelling indica expresses a duality of effects: heavy body effects that crush insomnia and pain coupled with an invigorating cerebral buzz. A 7 or 8 week flowering time is all Garlic Bud needs to reach full maturation, finishing with sizeable yields.",

A cross between parent strains OG Kush and Banana, Chiquita Banana leads with a potent heady sizzle (likely brought on by the enormous quantity of THC) which then melds into a Kush-esque body buzz that is relaxing but not sedative. These Kush effects continue to gain potency over time, “creeping” over the body. This powerful hybrid is an outstanding option for patients struggling to hurdle their tolerance barrier, and its effects are also well-suited for those suffering from chronic pain or nausea.",

Typical dab attachments to enjoy concentrates with a standard vape battery screw onto the top of the device, and then you load the wax into a chamber and on top of a coil. With the ConNectar, you save a few steps and there is no need to handle those sticky substances! \n\nAttaching the black ConNectar to the battery is a breeze. Separate the three pieces of the ConNectar for the easiest application. Screw the airflow base, or the little piece underneath the plastic straw, directly onto the battery as you would an oil cartridge. Slide the straw mouthpiece over and push it all the way down into place, then screw the Clapton Coil tip on and you now have a fully functioning nectar collector in your hand! \n\nEach dab you take with the ConNectar is rich and flavorful thanks to the Clapton coil technology. These coils provide a large surface area for the concentrates to vaporize, which allows you to really taste the terpenes in your extracts. These coils have varying temperatures throughout, which delivers a thick, delicious cloud and provides different flavor notes. We recommend trying out different temperature levels with each new strain you bring home. Different terpene flavors are more pronounced at different power levels! \n\nWe highly recommend using an Ooze Slim Twist Pen with the ConNectar. It’s the perfect shape to fit right under the mouthpiece, and the temperature dial allows you to hone in on the perfect heat level for your specific strain. That precise adjustment is crucial when using the Clapton coil. Never waste your product because your tip is too hot and destroys the terpenes, or because your tip is not hot enough to vaporizer the concentrate. Calibrate the battery to your exact liking and fine-tune your own experience!",

Natural Gas is a rare and exclusive strain from Kind Tree Cannabis, a cannabis company that focuses on organic and sustainable cultivation practices. Natural Gas is 19-28% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for experienced cannabis consumers who can handle a potent high. Leafly customers tell us Natural Gas effects include feeling relaxed, calm, and sedated. Medical marijuana patients often choose Natural Gas when dealing with symptoms associated with chronic pain, insomnia, and anxiety. Bred by Kind Tree Cannabis, Natural Gas features flavors like diesel, earthy, and berry. The dominant terpene of this strain is myrcene, which is often associated with a citrus aroma and relaxing effects. The average price of Natural Gas typically ranges from $31-$60 per eighth. Natural Gas is a beautiful strain with tight dense buds covered in frosty trichomes. The buds have a sweet and musky cookies smell that reminds some users of Skittles candy. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed Natural Gas, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

A true A-List cannabis strain, Blueberry’s legendary status soared to new heights after claiming the High Times’ Cannabis Cup 2000 for Best indica. The long history of the strain goes back to the late 1970s when American breeder DJ Short was working with a variety of exotic landrace strains. However, throughout the decades of Blueberry’s cultivation, the genetics have been passed around, due in large part to DJ Short working with multiple seed banks and breeders. The sweet flavors of fresh blueberries combine with relaxing effects to produce a long-lasting sense of euphoria. Many consumers utilize the effects of Blueberry to help contend with pain and stress, while connoisseurs and growers admire the strain for its colorful hues and high THC content.",

Whether you are soaking alone or with a partner, you will enjoy the soothing benefits of our hand-selected essential oils. Relax your body and mind and slip into a more sensual headspace.\n\nHow it Works:  Our Love bath bombs were created with the Entourage Effect in mind. The Entourage Effect occurs when you combine cannabinoids with terpenes/essential oils. Each blend is more than a scent, it is an experience. Our nourishing Love bath bombs combine the power of organic essential oils and cannabinoids to create effect-specific full-body experiences.\n\nThe Science: So why would you use a CBD bath bomb? Your skin is your largest organ and is a powerful tool for absorbing cannabinoids and balancing your endocannabinoid system. As you soak in the tub, your body absorbs the essential oils and the CBD, like a sponge. A bath bomb is a full-body topical application that allows for unparalleled all-over relief. These powerful molecules work together with your endocannabinod system creating a synergistic effect.\n\nThe Kush Queen Promise: Every bath bomb is handmade with the highest quality ingredients, sourced in the USA and never tested on animals.\n\nEssential Oils [Ylang Ylang, Orange, Patchouli], Cannabidiol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Pure Olive Oil, Food Grade Color (Color Yellow # 6, Color Red # 40, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate and Color Caramel Acid)",

Sacred Seed Co. originally bred Skunk #1 using diverse genetics from around the world; Afghani, Acapulco Gold, and Colombian Gold varieties converged through an intricate selective breeding process that spanned several generations, and finally the genetic cornerstone of countless cannabis hybrids was born. The original Skunk #1 gave rise to several variations that were later harvested in the gardens of Sensi Seeds, Dutch Passion, Flying Dutchmen, Nirvana Seeds, and Royal Queen Seeds. As its name suggests, Skunk #1 buds radiate with an aromatic blend of sour skunkiness and subtle earthy notes. This hybrid offers elevated creativity through its high-energy buzz, while stress and appetite loss melt away with Skunk #1’s potency.",

      "description": "RAW Black Paper is double pressed extra-fine for the thinnest unbleached rolling paper we have ever made. This unique artisan paper is produced in the Alcoy region of Spain where the dry Valencian winds make humidity optimally low.  RAW Black 1¼ is so thin that it allows you to truly taste your terps!  RAW Black was created for a new generation as the next level of top shelf smoking materials.  It’s like a Ferrari, it only runs on premium gas!\n\n50 leaves per pack\n24 packs per box",
