    "description": "Our journey into the cannabis industry started in 2012 when we purchased both Mary Janes Headquarters locations in Kelowna and West Kelowna. Our goal was to make the shopping experience a fun, chilled, informative, and comfortable experience. Making the transition from employee to entrepreneur was a huge learning curve and one hell of a ride. \n\nWe quickly realized how in-depth the cannabis industry and its connoisseurs were! The science is fascinating, and people are looking for particular ways to indulge – not to mention the accessory manufacturers are getting pretty creative! \n\nThere are many different ways of consuming cannabis, after all. Our clients want good recommendations for the best-proven quality sessions, available at different price points that work for every one of them. So we expanded, and expanded, and expanded some more.\n\nBasically, we loaded up our Mary Jane's HQ stores with a whole hell of a lot of cool stuff! \n\nThen 2018 came along (AKA legalization), and it made sense that our mega-cannabis accessories stores would sell begin to sell cannabis as well! We were beyond ecstatic (FINALLY!!!!). \n\nBut... after reading the copious pages of all the rules, it became pretty evident that we would have to change Mary Jane’s Headquarters too significantly to adhere to all of the rules. \n\nEssentially, transitioning the two stores into cannabis stores no longer made sense (because seriously, who wants to live in a world with no flavoured blunt wraps). \n\nThus Cheeba Cheeba’s was born. Today we are proud to boast that both Mary Jane’s Headquarters have a Cheeba Cheeba’s Recreational Cannabis store right beside them. \n\nBeing in the industry for the past ten years has allowed us to anticipate the needs of our consumers. We know you, and we love you. This is our community! We call West Kelowna our home- our kids go to school here, and we invest back here. It matters to us what you think. \n\nToday, several distinctive characteristics define the Cheeba Cheebas experience: a friendly & relaxed environment paired with knowledgeable staff and a vast selection of products.\n\nThis combination enables us to ensure the best shopping experience possible while serving up the freshest greens and goodies around! \n\nCome and visit us today and get yourself fixed up good!",

This strain produces a balanced high, along with effects such as cerebral stimulation and full-body relaxation. Blue dream is 18% THC but has a low CBD percentage, making this potent strain a fan favorite of both novice and veteran cannabis consumers. In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

This evenly balanced hybrid’s flavour is very sweet and fruity with berry-grape overtones that are accented with fresh, frosty mint and spicy herbs. KnL is known for their very small batches that are packed with terps and flavour from their small 16-light rooms. Followed by a three-week cure and burp, the flower is hand trimmed with very few smalls. Each pouch is hand packaged with bigs and mediums, and it’s never ever irradiated.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

      "strainDescription": "Blue Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Blueberry with Haze. This strain produces a balanced high, along with effects such as cerebral stimulation and full-body relaxation. Blue dream is 18% THC but has a low CBD percentage, making this potent strain a fan favorite of both novice and veteran cannabis consumers. In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

Unlike typical sativas, Ghost Train Haze grows dense buds blanketed in white, crystal-capped trichomes. With a sour citrus and floral aroma, Ghost Train Haze delivers a potent dose of THC to knock out pain, depression, and appetite loss, but patients prone to anxiety should steer clear of this heavy-hitter. Low doses are conducive to concentration and creativity, but you may notice some cerebral haziness as you smoke more.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",

Unlike typical sativas, Ghost Train Haze grows dense buds blanketed in white, crystal-capped trichomes. With a sour citrus and floral aroma, Ghost Train Haze delivers a potent dose of THC to knock out pain, depression, and appetite loss, but patients prone to anxiety should steer clear of this heavy-hitter. Low doses are conducive to concentration and creativity, but you may notice some cerebral haziness as you smoke more.",
