This strain produces a euphoric high with mentally uplifting effects. Consumers say Garlic Cookies promotes an incredible body high that leaves you feeling relaxed and free from pain. In large doses, this strain may lock you to the sofa and make you feel sedated. As a descendent from Girl Scout Cookies, you can expect loud flavors from Garlic Cookies, like a diesel aroma and a garlic-forward taste that lingers on your tastebuds. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with chronic pain, depression, and nausea. According to growers, Garlic Cookies flowers into light green, spade-shaped buds that are dusted with white trichomes and curly orange hairs. This strain was originally bred by Mamiko Seeds. If you've smoked, dabbed, or consumed Garlic Cookies (aka GMO Cookies) before, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

As a descendent from Girl Scout Cookies, you can expect loud flavors from Garlic Cookies, like a diesel aroma and a garlic-forward taste that lingers on your tastebuds. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with chronic pain, depression, and nausea. According to growers, Garlic Cookies flowers into light green, spade-shaped buds that are dusted with white trichomes and curly orange hairs. This strain was originally bred by Mamiko Seeds. If you've smoked, dabbed, or consumed Garlic Cookies (aka GMO Cookies) before, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Kootenays Finest takes pride in their commitment to excellence, and their micro cultivation facility nestled in the heart of the Kootenay region reflects that dedication. Their mission is clear: to provide you with the finest, small batch, organic craft cannabis possible. Their journey begins with the exceptional cultivar known as Monkey Business, a carefully crafted cross between Grease Monkey and Red Pop. It’s a 70/30 Indica/Sativa hybrid with a terpene profile showcasing a rich 2-4% Limonene-rich subtype, complemented by the delightful presence of Germacrene B and Caryophyllene. This unique blend of terpenes delivers an aroma that's both sweet and gassy.  Kootenays Finest proudly grows Monkey Business in living soil organic (LSO) beds, nourishing it with organic amendments sourced from small farms across beautiful British Columbia. Their dedication to sustainability knows no bounds – from seaweed harvested off the shores of Vancouver Island to nutrient-rich worm castings from the interior of BC, they ensure cannabis flourishes in the most natural and nourishing environment possible. Their cultivation process is a labor of love. Each plant is meticulously nurtured, receiving individual care as it's slow-cold cured, hand trimmed, and small-batch hand-watered with pure mountain spring water sourced from the majestic Purcell mountains. This level of care ensures that every bud is of the highest quality, dense, and beautifully tinged with shades of purple.",

Kootenays Finest proudly grows Monkey Business in living soil organic (LSO) beds, nourishing it with organic amendments sourced from small farms across beautiful British Columbia. Their dedication to sustainability knows no bounds – from seaweed harvested off the shores of Vancouver Island to nutrient-rich worm castings from the interior of BC, they ensure cannabis flourishes in the most natural and nourishing environment possible. Their cultivation process is a labor of love. Each plant is meticulously nurtured, receiving individual care as it's slow-cold cured, hand trimmed, and small-batch hand-watered with pure mountain spring water sourced from the majestic Purcell mountains. This level of care ensures that every bud is of the highest quality, dense, and beautifully tinged with shades of purple.",

The potency of this strain could be considered overpowering, and even small doses are known to eliminate pain, insomnia, and appetite loss. Growers have to wait 10 to 11 weeks for Pink Kush’s flowering, but high yields of top-shelf buds are worth the wait.",
