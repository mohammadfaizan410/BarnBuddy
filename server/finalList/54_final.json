Although this rare bud has never had its THC level officially measured, it is thought to have one that tops 20% on average. Even with its scarcity on the market, this strain is sought after for its sweet fruity flavor and euphoric effects. Like its parents, Blueberry Silvertip has a mouthwatering taste of sweet ripe blueberries with a hint of sage. The aroma is just as amazing, with earthy herbs and flowers topped with sweet berries and tropical fruits. If you like the taste, you'll love the effects.",

Reviewers on Leafly who have smoked this strain say it makes them feel mentally relaxed but physically energetic. Jealousy can test into the high 20s in terms of THC percentage, ideal for experienced cannabis consumers. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene, which is often associated with a fuel aroma. There's also limonene, myrcene, and sometimes even linalool and humulene. Reviewers tell Leafly Jealousy tastes earthy and funky. Medical marijuana patients say they buy this strain when feeling symptoms of mild stress. Jealousy was originally bred by Seed Junky Genetics.",

Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly becomeÂ one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",
