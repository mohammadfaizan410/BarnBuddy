Jenn’s OG Tire Fire brings a diesel-rich flavour profile, complemented by spicy and peppery notes brought forth by the dominant terpene, caryophyllene.

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

      "description": "Crazy Rntz is an exclusive Indica dominant strain of the Runtz family originated in Los Angeles combining the most flavourful and exotic strains available. Expect a psychedelic kick with a flavourful, sugary explosion when you try Crazy Rntz. It’s dense grape-shaped olive green nugs are supplemented with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones, and a coating of frosty tiny white, purple-tinted crystal trichomes. Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene. Offering a little mystery with its lineage Crazy Rntz is a cross of Runtz x Bonkers x Unknown Hybrid.",

Often referred to as a social high, it is going to relax you without slowing you down, and it's been said to offer a creative spark. This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing  Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

      "strainDescription": "Crazy Glue is a great all-around experience. Like a multi-tool, this strain is great in many situations without being overpowering in any one direction. Often referred to as a social high, it is going to relax you without slowing you down, and it's been said to offer a creative spark. This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

The flower is dank and stinky, and the fat popcorn shaped buds are filled with bright orange hairs and an overly generous coating of frosty white trichomes. Jenn’s OG Tire Fire brings a diesel-rich flavour profile, complemented by spicy and peppery notes brought forth by the dominant terpene, caryophyllene. The rich and pungent flower is pleasantly blended with a slightly minty and nutty cookie aftertaste, dominated by a typical hot rubber aftertaste hence the name, a true fire strain.",

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

The flower is dank and stinky, and the fat popcorn shaped buds are filled with bright orange hairs and an overly generous coating of frosty white trichomes. Jenn’s OG Tire Fire brings a diesel-rich flavour profile, complemented by spicy and peppery notes brought forth by the dominant terpene, caryophyllene. The rich and pungent flower is pleasantly blended with a slightly minty and nutty cookie aftertaste, dominated by a typical hot rubber aftertaste hence the name, a true fire strain.",

It’s dense grape-shaped olive green nugs are supplemented with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones, and a coating of frosty tiny white, purple-tinted crystal trichomes. Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene. Offering a little mystery with its lineage Crazy Rntz is a cross of Runtz x Bonkers x Unknown Hybrid.",

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

The flower is dank and stinky, and the fat popcorn shaped buds are filled with bright orange hairs and an overly generous coating of frosty white trichomes. Jenn’s OG Tire Fire brings a diesel-rich flavour profile, complemented by spicy and peppery notes brought forth by the dominant terpene, caryophyllene. The rich and pungent flower is pleasantly blended with a slightly minty and nutty cookie aftertaste, dominated by a typical hot rubber aftertaste hence the name, a true fire strain.",

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

Often referred to as a social high, it is going to relax you without slowing you down, and it's been said to offer a creative spark. This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",
