      "strainDescription": "Garlic Bud is a classic indica strain from the 90's, bred by The Seed Bank (now known as Sensi Seeds) using Afghani genetics. Its name is only loosely tied to Garlic Bud's aroma, which smells a lot more like tangy musk and spice than anything you'd throw in your stir fry. This pungent-smelling indica expresses a duality of effects: heavy body effects that crush insomnia and pain coupled with an invigorating cerebral buzz. A 7 or 8 week flowering time is all Garlic Bud needs to reach full maturation, finishing with sizeable yields.",

Sacred Seed Co. originally bred Skunk #1 using diverse genetics from around the world; Afghani, Acapulco Gold, and Colombian Gold varieties converged through an intricate selective breeding process that spanned several generations, and finally the genetic cornerstone of countless cannabis hybrids was born. The original Skunk #1 gave rise to several variations that were later harvested in the gardens of Sensi Seeds, Dutch Passion, Flying Dutchmen, Nirvana Seeds, and Royal Queen Seeds. As its name suggests, Skunk #1 buds radiate with an aromatic blend of sour skunkiness and subtle earthy notes. This hybrid offers elevated creativity through its high-energy buzz, while stress and appetite loss melt away with Skunk #1’s potency.",

      "description": "The original Blazy Susan Pink Papers are the premier pink rolling paper on the market. Rolling papers shouldn't be boring - so smoke pink! Proudly vegan and non-GMO, our Pink Papers are made in France using premium materials that deliver a high-quality slow burn with absolutely no aftertaste. Come for the pink, and stay for the quality. Our rolling papers are made out of  14.5GSM wood pulp for maximum self-stick and durability. Thin papers that are tough help even the most amateur roller feel like a pro! \n\n1 and 1/4\" rolling papers are the industry standard size - however, our booklets come with 50 papers. That's almost double the industry average of 32 papers per booklet! Get more bang (and smoke) for your buck.\n\n",
