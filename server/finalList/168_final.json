      "description": "Moon Drops, also known as “Moondrop” or “Moon Drop,” is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60% indica/40% sativa) created through crossing the infamous Purple Urkle X Do-Si-Dos strains. Named for its sleepy high and gorgeous appearance, this rarity is a favorite of patients and breeders alike. Moon Drops buds have tiny super dense deep purple and neon green nugs with vivid orange hairs and a coating of super thick frosty white crystal trichomes. As you break apart each sticky little nugget, aromas of sweet fruity herbs and dank pungent skunk are released, all with a lovely flowery overtone. The flavor is on the lighter side, with a sweet grape taste that transforms with skunky spices upon exhale. The Moon Drops high is just as mouthwatering as the flavor, with lifted and relaxing effects that are perfect for helping you get ready for bed at the end of a long and stressful day. You'll feel euphoric and lifted with an overarching sense of sedation that leaves you drifting away into a deep and peaceful sleep. With these effects and its high 20-25% average THC level, Moon Drops is said to be perfect for treating those suffering from conditions such as depression, headaches or migraines, insomnia, appetite loss or nausea and chronic pain.",

      "description": "Blood Orange is a sativa dominant hybrid strain that is a tasty phenotype of the infamous Tangie strain, a cross of Cali Orange X Appalachia. This mouth-watering bud takes the zesty sweet flavor of citrus from its Tangie parentage and infuses it with a heavy hit of spices for a truly delicious flavor that's certain to leave you begging for more. The Blood Orange aroma is just as flavorful, although much more potent, with hints of spicy sour citrus and zesty tangy earth. The eye-opening sour citrus flavor of Blood Orange lends itself well to the uplifting cerebral effects that come shortly after. The Blood Orange high fills you with a full bodied buzzing effect that leaves you feeling euphoric yet somehow calm and relaxed. You'll have a slight sense of energy that builds slowly over time alongside a sharp pang of hunger that leads to a ravenous case of the munchies. Coupled with its powerful 22-24% average THC level, Blood Orange is perfect for treating conditions such as appetite loss, chronic fatigue, pain, and depression. This bud has grape-shaped bright green nugs with dark orange hairs and a frosty dusting of fine milky white trichomes.",

These tingles start in the back of your neck and spine before spreading their buzzing tendrils throughout the entirety of your body, leaving you hopelessly relaxed, kicking back without a care in the world - that is, until the munchies hit. Be sure to have some snacks on hand, since you won't really be able to get up off the couch to hunt for any at this point. With these long-lasting effects and its high 18-28% average THC level, Peanut Butter Breath is often chosen to treat conditions such as appetite loss or nausea, depression, chronic stress, or chronic pain. This bud has long grape-shaped olive green nugs with bright red-orange hairs and a coating of thick frosty white purple-tinted crystal trichomes.",

It has long been a favorite of stoners and medical marijuana patients here. Durban Poison has THC levels that can reach 24%, making it one of the world's more powerful strains. This strain hits with a strong, happy head high that's great for creativity and daytime errands. Paranoia may be a possible side effect, along with dry mouth. Durban Poison is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety, as well as chronic pain, and it can also be helpful with nausea. This strain is ideal for making concentrates, as the bud is covered in over-sized trichomes. The dominant smell and taste of Durban Poison is earthy and sweet, with a subtle pine aroma. The buds are round and chunky, with a dense coating of trichomes. This strain is best for active periods, chores, and other daylight activities.",

As your mind creeps higher and higher, your body will begin to drift away into a relaxing state that is very sedative and heady, often leading to a long and peaceful sleep. In combination with its high THC level, these effects make Purple Punch perfect for killing the effects of insomnia, chronic stress, nausea, chronic pain, and depression. This bud has fluffy oversized bright neon green nugs with sparse red orange hairs and a coating of frosty tiny amber crystal trichomes. As you break apart each little nugget, aromas of earthy blueberries and grapes are released accented by a sweet herbal overtone. The flavor is very sweet with a vanilla blueberry taste that has a touch of slightly sour grape candy.",

Punny name aside, 3 in the Pink is the perfect high-powered indica for any patient who wants to get to sleep and get there fast. The high has a subtle build of effects, starting slow with a light relaxation and drowsiness before launching you forward into a state of heavy sedation and ease. You'll feel deeply relaxed from head to toe with a deepfelt sense of calm in both mind and body. These effects will quickly take a heavy turn, leaving you dozing off before you know it. With these effects and its super high 25-26% average THC level, 3 in the Pink is often chosen to treat those suffering from conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, muscle spasms or cramps and nausea or appetite loss. This bud has a sweet and spicy sour citrus flavor that lingers on the tongue. The aroma is very similar, although with a spicier and more herbal overtone and touches of light earth. 3 in the Pink buds have long narrow spade-shaped minty green nugs with lots of light orange hairs and a coating of frosty golden amber crystal trichomes.",

The Ayahuasca Purple high has everything you'd expect from a bud of this name. You'll experience deep relaxation and happiness accompanied by vivid creative visions that last for hours on end. You'll feel a cerebral onset that builds in the back of your mind before filling your mind with unfocused euphoria. A light body buzz comes next, filling your physical form with a tingly effect that soon lulls you into a sleepy and sedated state. Surprisingly, you'll still be pretty sociable, even with the heavy sedation. Thanks to these effects and its high 21% average THC level and 1-2% CBD level, Ayahuasca Purple is often chosen to treat conditions such as depression, insomnia, ADD or ADHD, anorexia, and chronic anxiety or stress. This bud has deep purple fluffy nugs with rich amber undertones, dark orange hairs, and a coating of clear crystal trichomes. As each little nugget is broken apart, aromas of nutty tropical fruits are released accented by a sharp pungency. The flavor is just as addictive, with a fresh floral mango flavor accented by mouthwatering papaya and fresh earth.",

The aroma is of the same nature, with a light pungent effect to it that's released as the nugs are burned. The Ice Cream Cake high is just as beautiful as the flavor, with lifted and relaxing effects that will have you kicking back in no time flat. The high starts with a rush of cerebral effects that lift your mind into a state of pure happiness and ease, pushing out any negative or racing thoughts immediately. Soon after, a relaxing body high will start to creep into your physical form, leaving you falling deeper and deeper into a couch-locked state of sedation before you eventually begin to drift away. With these calming effects and its high 20-25% average THC level, Ice Cream Cake is said to be perfect for treating those suffering from depression, chronic pain, insomnia, and nausea or appetite loss.

The result was a hybrid with a unique terpene profile that boasts a complex aroma with notes of fuel, skunk, and spice. OG often refers to “Original Gangster,” indicating either the strain’s authenticity or intensity.  OG Kush should smell like lemon-pine-fuel with a high-THC, mixed head and body effect. It's often enjoyed in the back half of the day to ease stress.  The genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, OG Kush arrived in Los Angeles in 1996 when Matt “Bubba” Berger brought it (along with “The Bubba,” which was later used to create the famed Bubba Kush) from Florida to legendary cultivator Josh D. Since then, OG Kush has become a worldwide staple used to create numerous famous strains like GSC and Headband. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush weed, including Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Ghost OG.",

Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both cerebral elevation and heavy resin production. Its rich genetic background gives rise to several different variations of Jack Herer, each phenotype bearing its own unique features and effects. Leafly reviewers tell us that Jack Herer’s effects include feeling energetic, creative, and uplifted. However, consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative. Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s, where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, this spicy, pine-scented strain has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency.",

With this bud, the name says it all. Get ready for a hard-hitting slam of flavor and effects that will have you falling head over heels after just one toke. Black Cherry Punch has a super sweet fruity cherry flavor with hints of spicy florals and woody pine. The aroma is potent, with a heavily sweet earthy cherry smell that's accented by spicy herbs and woody pine. The Black Cherry Punch packs just as powerful a hit, sucker-punching your head before taking on your entire body. It starts with a tingle in the forehead and behind the eyes that suddenly launches forward, throwing you into a state of pure unfocused euphoria and happiness. This is accompanied by a one-two punch of super calming and relaxing physical effects that have you totally kicked back and at ease in no time flat. With these potent effects and its high 24-25% average THC level and 1-3% CBD level, Black Cherry Punch is often chosen to treat chronic stress, depression, chronic pain, nausea or appetite loss and chronic fatigue. This bud has grape-shaped minty green nugs with thin light orange hairs and a coating of frosty tiny white crystal trichomes.",

It starts with a one-two punch to the face of effects, launching your mind into high-flying energy and unfocused euphoria. You'll feel stimulated yet calmed, free of any negative or racing thoughts, and perhaps free from thought entirely. This punch of stimulation will soon work its way throughout your entire body, leaving you kicked back and relaxed, ready to take in some tunes or just vibe with friends. In combination with its super high 22-26% average THC level, these effects make Gorilla Punch a great option for treating conditions such as chronic stress or PTSD, depression, appetite loss or nausea, mood swings and Multiple Sclerosis. This bud has a flowery and sweet fruity berry flavor with a lightly sour citrusy exhale. The aroma is very orangey and citrusy in nature, with light touches of spicy berries and earth, too. Gorilla Punch buds have fat spade-shaped piecey bright neon green nugs with vivid purple undertones, long thin red-orange hairs and a coating of frosty purple crystal trichomes.",

The taste is a perfect combination of sweetness of cookies and fruitiness of a cherry pie. It works as a calming agent and appetite stimulator, and is quite helpful for patients who experience regular depression-associated syndromes, fibromyalgia, MS and other such related symptoms. It may act as a sedative for patients, but does help in calming down nerves or controlling anxiety stimulating symptoms. Although it might not completely hamper your focus and energy levels, it will cause the usual drying out of eyes and mouth. This particular medical marijuana is grown indoors. It is observed to contain a THC level of 25%. In terms of physical features, it is shaped like pine trees and looks dense in its structural form. It is quite frosty looking and has dark green leaves. This particular medical marijuana is also thickly dressed up with orange hair all over it. It is most generally known for its sugary taste, as well as high potency value.",

      "strainDescription": "The origins and genetics of Huckleberry are under debate, but there is no disputing the strain’s unmistakable berry aroma. The flower is compact, light green in color, and generally covered in orange hairs. Huckleberry plants have a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and produce average yields. They might be a bit tricky for the novice grower. The effects of this strain are on the milder side and largely reported as relaxing, cutting through stress without the cloudiness. Undoubtedly, this strain is best known for its intense fruity smell and taste, similar to its relative Blueberry.",
