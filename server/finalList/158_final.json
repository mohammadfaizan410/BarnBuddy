Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with chronic pain, depression, and nausea. According to growers, Garlic Cookies flowers into light green, spade-shaped buds that are dusted with white trichomes and curly orange hairs. This strain was originally bred by Mamiko Seeds. If you've smoked, dabbed, or consumed Garlic Cookies (aka GMO Cookies) before, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Pair with your favorite chill spot for the ultimate relaxation. \n\nAt its core, Groove’s bubble hash is a pure cannabis concentrate comprising trichomes that have been separated from the cannabis plant using only ice water extraction, filtration and freeze drying. Once extracted, the trichomes are then hand molded into a brick and slow-cured to perfection in a carefully controlled environment which produces high-grade solventless bubble hash. To consume, break the hash ball apart and sprinkle onto a bowl of your favorite Groove flower, or roll into a joint or blunt. *Dabbing this product is not recommended.

      "description": "\"This strain is an active, gassy sativa hybrid that is a cross between Lemon Tree and Grease Monkey. Identified by citrus notes and diesel notes, this strain is truly unique.\n\nWhile Lemon Tree adds focus and happiness to the experience, Grease Monkey is fueled by a body buzz giving it a euphoric feeling.\n\"\n\nMost cannabis consumers are familiar with joints or pre-made joints a.k.a. “pre-rolls”. However, infused pre-rolls take it one step further by infusing hash with the flower before it is rolled. Groove’s infused pre-rolls consist of its top-shelf, premium indoor flower (no trim or shake) combined with Groove’s signature solventless bubble hash. The combined ingredients are then rolled in an ultra-thin rice paper that allows the true flavor of the flower and hash to shine. Whether you're on the go, at home, or on the mountain -- Groove's infused pre roll 3-packs are the perfect opening act for your next adventure.",
