This sweet, tropical confection-flavored cultivar came to market in the 2010s. According to the story, the cultivar came from an individual dubbed Gas Station Bob. Working as Terp Hogz, the growers Fields and Tony Mendo popularized Z with the help of 3rd Gen Family's Brandon Parker—growing the strain, entering it into contests, and making new crosses. The Original Z won 1st Place at the 2016 Emerald Cup, the 2023 King of Z Hill, and has placed in several Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Both Terp Hogz and 3rd Gen Fam—as well as other breeders—continue to refine the varietal.  In 2023, Terp Hogz announced they will use the name \"The Original Z,\" as part of a settlement with a candy company over alleged trademark infringement.  This strain features medium-sized, spongy green colas that with a sweet, tropical blend of fruit flavors. The effects of The Original Z are calming, leaving consumers focused, alert, and happy while relaxing the body to help unwind any time of day.",

The Lemon aspect is where we get our dominant terpene, Myrcene. Myrcene is great for relaxation, anxiety relief and clearing your head. Limonene is another active terpene in this strain. Limonene is great for fighting, stress, anxiety, depression and all those things people do not want. It provides joyful and energizing feelings all day. The skunk aspect is what old school smokers are after. I have heard many 60+ smokers rave about buds that smell like skunk, so getting their eyes on this product is ideal.",

      "description": "Fruity Crispy Covered with White Chocolate \n92.27 mg THC and 248.60mg Delta 8 THC\n\n5 BENEFITS DELTA 8 COULD OFFER YOU\nDelta 8 exhibits a lower psychotropic potency than delta-9 THC, so it doesn’t bind to the receptor as well. This helps it demonstrate a variety of properties that present as powerful benefits, so let’s take a look at the biggest ones below.\n1. Neuroprotective properties for a healthier brain\nSome research also suggests that delta-8 THC could help people produce Acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter. This neurotransmitter is responsible for memory, cognition, neuroplasticity, and even arousal. That’s a lot of benefits of delta 8 THC, and it appears to have close to or zero negative side effects.\n2. Has been shown to stimulate appetite\nIn 2004, researchers analyzed delta-8’s effect on appetite control. They concluded with the trial, noting that even low doses of delta-8 stimulated an increase in food intake.\n3. Little or no nausea thanks to its antiemetic effects\nWe know based on the 1995 study that delta-8 appears to have no negative side effects while eliminating nausea. The children undergoing chemotherapy for their cancer saw a 100% success rate in reducing their nausea over 480 treatments in total.\n4. Analgesic properties – which means less pain overall\nEveryone experiences pain differently, and at different degrees, but researchers have observed delta-8’s ability to help relieve some of that pain. Having analgesic properties means it can relieve pain to some degree.\nParticularly\nTHC distillate is a highly potent cannabis oil produced during a distillation process that extracts THC — the active cannabinoid compound responsible for inducing a high — from the cannabis plant itself.\nThis complex process results in a final product that could be considered one of the purest forms of THC.\nDistillate is the base ingredient of most edibles .

Vape cartridges contain concentrated cannabis oil that is heated by a battery and vaporized for inhalation. These products are very potent and are designed to be consumed in 2-3 second puffs.",
