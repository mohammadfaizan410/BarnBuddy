Sure, it’s a sativa-hybrid that’s a whole lot of sweet and a little bit spicy, with just a hint of berry. Yes, its smoke is rich and silky smooth (you’d expect that from a recipe handed down from OG Kush and Durban P). But Platinum Cookies are far from soft and chewy. It hits hard with potent THC levels. No sir, Platinum Cookies is no ordinary cookie. Your relative’s cookies are yesterday’s news. The future is platinum, my friend. And the future is starting to feel pretty good. Palmetto is cannabis for people who like cannabis, grown in the heartland of Alberta so you're always good to go.",

Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing  Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

In its exceptional variations, pink hairs burst from bright green buds barely visible under a blanket of sugar-like trichomes, with traces of a sweet vanilla and candy perfume. The potency of this strain could be considered overpowering, and even small doses are known to eliminate pain, insomnia, and appetite loss. Growers have to wait 10 to 11 weeks for Pink Kush’s flowering, but high yields of top-shelf buds are worth the wait.",

Sure, it’s a sativa-hybrid that’s a whole lot of sweet and a little bit spicy, with just a hint of berry. Yes, its smoke is rich and silky smooth (you’d expect that from a recipe handed down from OG Kush and Durban P). But Platinum Cookies are far from soft and chewy. It hits hard with potent THC levels. No sir, Platinum Cookies is no ordinary cookie. Your relative’s cookies are yesterday’s news. The future is platinum, my friend. And the future is starting to feel pretty good. Palmetto is cannabis for people who like cannabis, grown in the heartland of Alberta so you're always good to go.",

No sir, Platinum Cookies is no ordinary cookie. Your relative’s cookies are yesterday’s news. The future is platinum, my friend. And the future is starting to feel pretty good.
