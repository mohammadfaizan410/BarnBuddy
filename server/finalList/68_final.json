      "description": "● CBD \nBethany and Justin received a cutting of Charlotte’s Web in the Medical Marijuana Dispensary  days of 2012 that they grew for a very special patient until his passing, Rest in Peace Jackson.  Falcanna’s Charlotte’s Web typically tests in the high teens for CBD making it a desirable choice \nfor patients that need higher percentages of CBD to feel relief. She has beautiful round flowers  that have pastel pink and purple hues. For the nose, she has sweet hints of honeysuckle, fresh  lavender and pine with a light floral lavender exhale when combusted. A go-to strain for those  looking for the body relief without the feeling of being ‘high’.",

These unique and proprietary genetics are used by Charlotte's Web (the company) to create extracts for a variety of health and wellness products. Contrary to popular belief, Charlotte’s Web products are hemp-derived and are non-intoxicating. Charlotte’s Web gained popularity after being featured on CNN’s Weed 2 for the effects it had on Charlotte Figi, a young girl with a rare seizure disorder. New consumers should consult their doctor with any medical concerns. ",

      "strainDescription": "Runtz, also known as \"Runtz OG,\" is a rare type of  hybrid marijuana strain. Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing  Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

      "strainDescription": "Super Lemon Haze, sometimes called \"SLH,\" is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain of Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze and two time Cannabis Cup winner from Green House Seeds. Super Lemon Haze is a kief-caked multi-colored wonder. As the name states this strain has real lemony characteristics. The smell is zesty, citrusy, and a little sweet. As for the taste, it's everything one would expect from the namesake; tart and sweet like lemonheads candy - not quite as sharp as one might expect. The effects are uniquely energetic and lively, may not be the best strain for those of us that are naturally wound-up tight.",

This pure sativa landrace is sometimes called “Thai Sticks” because of the way its buds are traditionally dried and tied into long sticks. This original Thai variety has given rise to many strains we commonly see on the market today, including Voodoo, Juicy Fruit, and the classic Haze. Thai induces powerful but comfortable effects and has a distinct fruity, citrus aroma. This strain is a challenge for growers outside tropical climates, but greenhouse gardens make this grow possible for experts patient enough for Thai’s long growth cycle and slow flowering.",

This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

The story of Face Off OG begins in the late 1990s in California when Archive Seeds was gifted with the seeds of an exceptional OG Kush phenotype. This 70/30 indica-dominant hybrid shares its name with the 1997 movie in which Nicolas Cage and John Travolta literally swap faces (“I want to take his face…off!”), and the experience this strain has to offer could arguably be compared to losing your face. Dizzying euphoria goes straight to the head in an intensely psychoactive experience best reserved for veteran consumers. Its crushing full-body effects make this strain a great choice for consumers attending to physical discomfort or for relaxing on a lazy weekend.",

Leafly customers tell us the effects of Caffeine include an initial burst of energy and heightened focus. This often transitions into a feeling of euphoria and uplifted mood, making Caffeine an ideal choice for daytime activities and productivity. The sativa-dominant nature of the strain contributes to its invigorating effects, which can help combat fatigue and promote a sense of mental clarity. Medical marijuana patients often turn to Caffeine for relief from symptoms associated with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and lack of focus. The strain's mood-enhancing effects, combined with its potential to increase alertness and motivation, can provide a sense of mental relief and vitality. Additionally, Caffeine's potential to reduce stress and promote a positive outlook on the day can be particularly beneficial for managing mood-related challenges. Caffeine features a flavor profile that combines elements of its parent strains. Users often describe a mix of earthy and herbal flavors with hints of citrus and pine. This complex flavor experience adds to the overall enjoyment of consuming Caffeine. The dominant terpene found in Caffeine is limonene, contributing to its potential mood-enhancing effects and citrusy aroma. The average price of Caffeine can vary depending on location and dispensary, but it typically falls within the mid to higher price range. Caffeine's energizing effects and potential therapeutic benefits have positioned it as a notable sativa-dominant hybrid strain in the cannabis community.

      "strainCategory": "Hybrid",
      "strainDescription": "Caffeine is a sativa-dominant hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Northern Lights and Columbian Gold. This strain showcases a genetic composition that is approximately 70% sativa and 30% indica, resulting in a stimulating and uplifting cannabis experience. With a THC content that typically ranges between 15% and 20%, this strain can cater to both beginners and experienced cannabis consumers who desire a moderate to moderately high potency. Leafly customers tell us the effects of Caffeine include an initial burst of energy and heightened focus. This often transitions into a feeling of euphoria and uplifted mood, making Caffeine an ideal choice for daytime activities and productivity. The sativa-dominant nature of the strain contributes to its invigorating effects, which can help combat fatigue and promote a sense of mental clarity. Medical marijuana patients often turn to Caffeine for relief from symptoms associated with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and lack of focus. The strain's mood-enhancing effects, combined with its potential to increase alertness and motivation, can provide a sense of mental relief and vitality. Additionally, Caffeine's potential to reduce stress and promote a positive outlook on the day can be particularly beneficial for managing mood-related challenges. Caffeine features a flavor profile that combines elements of its parent strains. Users often describe a mix of earthy and herbal flavors with hints of citrus and pine. This complex flavor experience adds to the overall enjoyment of consuming Caffeine. The dominant terpene found in Caffeine is limonene, contributing to its potential mood-enhancing effects and citrusy aroma. The average price of Caffeine can vary depending on location and dispensary, but it typically falls within the mid to higher price range. Caffeine's energizing effects and potential therapeutic benefits have positioned it as a notable sativa-dominant hybrid strain in the cannabis community. If you've had the opportunity to try Caffeine, consider sharing your insights and experiences by leaving a strain review.",
