Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

      "strainDescription": "Cherry Bomb is popular thanks to its reputation as a great strain for daytime consumption, providing mild to moderate effects. Effects take off fast, giving many consumers a strong buzz. Immediate effects tend to be active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either.

It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene.

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

      "strainDescription": "Cherry Bomb is popular thanks to its reputation as a great strain for daytime consumption, providing mild to moderate effects. Effects take off fast, giving many consumers a strong buzz. Immediate effects tend to be active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

Expect a psychedelic kick with a flavourful, sugary explosion when you try Crazy Rntz. It’s dense grape-shaped olive green nugs are supplemented with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones, and a coating of frosty tiny white, purple-tinted crystal trichomes. Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene. Offering a little mystery with its lineage Crazy Rntz is a cross of Runtz x Bonkers x Unknown Hybrid.",

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

      "strainDescription": "Cherry Bomb is popular thanks to its reputation as a great strain for daytime consumption, providing mild to moderate effects. Effects take off fast, giving many consumers a strong buzz. Immediate effects tend to be active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

Expect a psychedelic kick with a flavourful, sugary explosion when you try Crazy Rntz. It’s dense grape-shaped olive green nugs are supplemented with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones, and a coating of frosty tiny white, purple-tinted crystal trichomes. Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene. Offering a little mystery with its lineage Crazy Rntz is a cross of Runtz x Bonkers x Unknown Hybrid.",

This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

Effects take off fast, giving many consumers a strong buzz. Immediate effects tend to be active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

      "description": "Crazy Rntz is an exclusive Indica dominant strain of the Runtz family originated in Los Angeles combining the most flavourful and exotic strains available. Expect a psychedelic kick with a flavourful, sugary explosion when you try Crazy Rntz. It’s dense grape-shaped olive green nugs are supplemented with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones, and a coating of frosty tiny white, purple-tinted crystal trichomes. Smells and tastes of sour grape candy abounds with a creamy mild fuel undertone. This profile is an expertly balanced representation of both ends of the spectrum. Aromas of hops, vanilla icing and nostalgic fruity flavours over a dank herbal foundation based on the terpenes Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene. Offering a little mystery with its lineage Crazy Rntz is a cross of Runtz x Bonkers x Unknown Hybrid.",

      "strainDescription": "Crazy Glue is a great all-around experience. Like a multi-tool, this strain is great in many situations without being overpowering in any one direction. Often referred to as a social high, it is going to relax you without slowing you down, and it's been said to offer a creative spark. This is a potent strain with low anxiety, making it great for most tolerance levels. A cross between Original Glue and Super Silver Chemdawg Haze, Crazy Glue smashes together two very different flavor profiles without yielding to either. You are going to get a complex smattering of spice, pepper, pine, sweetness, and earth. People who like to smell their cannabis before they smoke it will especially appreciate all the different aromas of Crazy Glue before partaking. ",

It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",
