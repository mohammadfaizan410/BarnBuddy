    "description": "Founded in 2008, 4th generation family owned and operated Holistic Releaf By Design was formed by a mother and son who became passionate about natural, alternative healing and healthcare. It wasn’t long before they saw a serious need for ethical, professional and compassionate cannabis products and services. Always ambassadors for ending cannabis prohibition, we salute everyone who got involved and helped pay and pave the way for the legalization movement. HRBD proudly and selflessly joined forces with other like-minded cannabis supporters, working together over the years to lobby the state on behalf of fair laws and access to legal cannabis.\nWhat you put into your body matters and how we treat the earth does too, we knew we had to be dedicated to higher quality cannabis and safer growing practices. A leader in sustainable and regenerative growing practices, we are willing to invest in holistic practices from the plants to the products. Chemicals are never sprayed or fed to our plants and organic ingredients used whenever possible. Organic ingredients are used whenever possible in our edibles.\nAward winning craft cannabis paired with excellent employees is how we are one of the best dispensaries to not only shop but work for. Everyone thrives in a positive, healthy environment and we love investing in our staff so they can be their best!",

This strain exhibits powerful, full-body effects that are elevated by a jolt of cerebral energy and carefree state of mind. Sherbet boasts a THC level of 18% and may be overwhelming to novice cannabis consumers. The high potency of Sherbert makes it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief from symptoms associated with stress, tension, and mood disorders. This strain features a sweet, dessert-like flavor profile with notes of skunky citrus, sweet berry, and candy. The average price per gram of Sherbert is $20, but may vary based on your location. According to growers, Sherbert flowers into oblong fluffy nugs with rich trichome coverage and dark amber hairs throughout light and dark green foliage. This strain was originally bred by Mr. Sherbinski, who bred Sherbert intentionally to inherit the genetic lineage of its parent strain Girl Scout Cookies.",

As you break apart each sticky little nug, fresh aromas of earthy lemon and sweet woodiness are released, which become slightly spicy as the nugs are burned. The flavor is very tangy and sweet with a lemony pine taste that lingers on your tongue long after you finish toking. Almost as soon as you experience your first smooth exhale, the effects of Lemonhead will hit you. You'll feel an onset of happy lifted energy that rushes through your brain with dazing euphoria and focus accompanied by a growing sense of energy. This is accompanied by a sense of motivation with a touch of relaxation that leaves you grounded as your mind soars. Thanks to these effects and its high THC level, Lemonhead is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as cramps or spasms, chronic pain, depression, appetite loss, and chronic stress.",

Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help treat symptoms related to muscle spasms and nerve damage. Growers say Romulan produces dense, frosty buds and is a popular choice among growers in the Pacific Northwest.",

      "strainDescription": "Gelato, also known as \"Larry Bird\" and \"Gelato #42\" is an evenly-balanced hybrid marijuana strain made from a crossing of Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies. With its balance of indica &amp; sativa, this strain produces a euphoric high accompanied by strong feelings of relaxation. Consumers who have smoked Gelato say the effects of the strain come on quickly. You'll be left feeling numb to pain, relaxed, but mentally stimulated and productive. As far as potency goes, Gelato boasts a THC level of 21%, making it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief for pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high THC tolerance will delight in the heavy-handed effects this strain offers. In terms of taste, Gelato is sweet and features fruity and creamy flavors and aromas. According to growers, this strain produces buds that bloom in dark purple hues and are illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shiny white coating of crystal resin. The average price per gram of Gelato is $12. Because Gelato has reached a legendary status among cannabis connoisseurs, it comes as no surprise it's been used to make a variety of other high-quality Gelato strains, including Gelato #3, Gelato #33, Gelato #41, and Gelato #45.",

Providing consumers with a well-balanced experience, Strawberry Diesel relaxes your muscles while creating an energizing, clear-headed sensation. If you’re looking for help with insomnia and would like to get things done, Strawberry Diesel may be your perfect match. Great for both daytime and nighttime use, this strain is incredibly versatile. Novice consumers should be cautious with it, however, as it is fast-acting and intense. Great for indoor growing, Strawberry Diesel tends to flower between 9 and 10 weeks. Taking after both of its parents, this strain also features a fruity scent while providing a thick, diesel-like taste.",
