Leafly customers tell us TK41 effects include tingly, relaxed, and euphoric. Medical marijuana patients often choose TK41 when dealing with symptoms associated with anxiety, stress, and depression. Bred by unknown breeders, TK41 features flavors like apple, apricot and honey. The dominant terpene of this strain is unknown. Named for its explosively thick fruit flavor, it's available as flower or extract. Growers of all skill levels and grow it indoors, outdoors, and in greenhouses.The average price of TK41 typically ranges from $15-$20 per gram. TK41 is also known as White Gushers or White Gusherz, and has a fruity and gassy aroma. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed TK41, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",
