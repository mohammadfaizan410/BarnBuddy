Green and purple hues weave through the buds beneath a crystalline layer of trichomes, from which sprout Phantom Cookiesâ electric orange hairs. Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybridâs crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

This sweet, tropical confection-flavored cultivar came to market in the 2010s. According to the story, the cultivar came from an individual dubbed Gas Station Bob. Working as Terp Hogz, the growers Fields and Tony Mendo popularized Z with the help of 3rd Gen Family's Brandon Parkerâgrowing the strain, entering it into contests, and making new crosses. The Original Z won 1st Place at the 2016 Emerald Cup, the 2023 King of Z Hill, and has placed in several Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Both Terp Hogz and 3rd Gen Famâas well as other breedersâcontinue to refine the varietal.  In 2023, Terp Hogz announced they will use the name \"The Original Z,\" as part of a settlement with a candy company over alleged trademark infringement.  This strain featuresÂ medium-sized, spongy green colasÂ that with a sweet, tropical blend of fruit flavors. The effects of The Original Z are calming,Â leaving consumers focused, alert, and happy while relaxing the body to help unwind any time of day.",

Few strains compare to Green Crackâs sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\"Â perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a âCâ) or Green Cush instead.",

The flower is compact, light green in color, and generally covered in orange hairs. Huckleberry plants have a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and produce average yields. They might be a bit tricky for the novice grower. The effects of this strain are on the milder side and largely reported as relaxing, cutting through stress without the cloudiness. Undoubtedly, this strain is best known for its intense fruity smell and taste, similar to its relative Blueberry.",

This sweet, tropical confection-flavored cultivar came to market in the 2010s. According to the story, the cultivar came from an individual dubbed Gas Station Bob. Working as Terp Hogz, the growers Fields and Tony Mendo popularized Z with the help of 3rd Gen Family's Brandon Parkerâgrowing the strain, entering it into contests, and making new crosses. The Original Z won 1st Place at the 2016 Emerald Cup, the 2023 King of Z Hill, and has placed in several Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Both Terp Hogz and 3rd Gen Famâas well as other breedersâcontinue to refine the varietal.  In 2023, Terp Hogz announced they will use the name \"The Original Z,\" as part of a settlement with a candy company over alleged trademark infringement.  This strain featuresÂ medium-sized, spongy green colasÂ that with a sweet, tropical blend of fruit flavors. The effects of The Original Z are calming,Â leaving consumers focused, alert, and happy while relaxing the body to help unwind any time of day.",

      "strainDescription": "Chemdawg, officially named \"Chemdog,\"Â is a hybrid marijuana strain grown and spread by the breeder Chemdog since 1991. In a Leafly interview, Chemdog relates how Chemdog came from what was thought to be Northern California bag seed, via a Colorado Grateful Dead concert. Chem 91, Chem 4, and Chem Sis are all variations on Chemdog. The original name Chemdog came from two names for the same bud \"Chem\" and \"Dog bud.\" Chemdog evolved into the variation 'Chemdawg' over time and distance as other growers and breeders propagated it, with the latter name becoming more dominant. Leafly customers tell us Chemdawg effects include feeling euphoric, uplifted, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose Chemdawg when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Chemdog is a staple strain in cannabis and may be a source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdog is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, youâll be able to smell this strainÂ from a mile away. Cannabis newbies be warned: Chemdog tends to be very potent.Â Consumers can expect to have a cerebral experience, coupled with a strong heavy-bodied feeling.Â ",

The effects are uniquely energetic and lively, may not be the best strain for those of us that are naturally wound-up tight.",

Sweet hashish flavors with subtle notes of chocolate and coffee come through on the exhale, delighting the palate as powerful relaxation takes over. From head to toe, muscles ease with heaviness as dreamy euphoria blankets the mind, crushing stress while bringing happy moods. Bubba Kush exhibits a distinctive, bulky bud structure with hues that range from forest green to pale purple.\n\nBubbaâs stocky plant stature and bulky bud structure suggest Afghani descent, but its genetic origins arenât certain. The breeder whom this strain was named after states that Bubba Kush emerged just after 1996, when an OG KushÂ pollinated an unknown indica strain obtained in New Orleans.

These classic OG aromas blend nicely with medical-grade body effects that lean toward the sedative side with the addition of Face Off OG genetics. Those who smoke Dosi can enjoy a stoney, in-your-face buzz off the start that melts down over the body, prettifying the consumer with relaxation that emanates outward. The dominant terpene in Dosidos is limonene.",

As for the taste, it's everything one would expect from the namesake; tart and sweet like lemonheads candy - not quite as sharp as one might expect. The effects are uniquely energetic and lively, may not be the best strain for those of us that are naturally wound-up tight.",

      "strainDescription": "Jack Herer, also known as \"JH,\" \"The Jack,\" \"Premium Jack,\" and \"Platinum Jack\" is a sativa-dominant marijuana strain that has gained as much renown as its namesake, the marijuana activist and author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both cerebral elevation and heavy resin production. Its rich genetic background gives rise to several different variations of Jack Herer, each phenotype bearing its own unique features and effects. Leafly reviewers tell us that Jack Hererâs effects include feeling energetic, creative, and uplifted. However, consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative. Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s, where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, this spicy, pine-scented strain has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency.",

      "description": "RAW Tips are made on an antique Fourdrinier paper machine. Whereas RAW papers are made in Alcoy Spain, we only have machines to produce thin paper in Alcoy. For the thick tipping paper we had to travel to an old paper mill in Northern China that was still using an original Fourdrinier. This was the only place we could find that still had one of these old machines in use, which we needed to make the special long-fiber paper for RAW tips. Want to know more? Modern paper mills use small-structure cellulose to make paper. The original paper mills used fiber instead. For tipping paper to perform best, it needs to be made from fiber â not just boiled cellulose. Fiber-based tips roll smooth AND have enough structural rigidity to both keep its shape in your mouth AND to not dissolve. There are precious few of the original Fourdrinier paper machines in use because theyâre antiques and expensive to operate. We were lucky to find this old mill, itâs the only one in the world that can produce RAW tips to our specifications.",

      "description": "RAW Natural Rolling Papers have developed a cult-like following. RAW are pure, less processed rolling papers unlike anything that you have ever seen or smoked. Because they contain a hybrid blend of unbleached (not chlorine whitened) fibers, the paper is a translucent natural light brown color. RAW is so thin that you can see through it. Each paper is watermarked with our patented CrissCross watermark. This special watermark helps prevent runs and maintains the smooth even-burning characteristics that we are famous for. RAW is available in many sizes and styles to suit the most discerning smoking connoisseur. Enjoy your favorite smoke in its purest RAW form.",
