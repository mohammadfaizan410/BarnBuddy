Runtz is made by Cookies Fam by crossing  Zkittlez with Gelato and it is loved for its incredibly fruity flavor profile that smells just like a bag of the sugary candy we all know and love. Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

Rouge. The strain has the sharp aroma of clean clothes mixed with pine, citrus and even cheese notes, and buds that grow in spade-like formation in shades of deep purple and hunter green under clusters of white calyxes and orange hairs. French Laundry gives your brain a wash, with a calming but perky euphoria for recreational consumers and medical patients seeking help with stress. French Laundry has won multiple accolades, including top honors at the 2023 Farmers Cup, Best Looking and Most Unique at the 2023 California Zalympix, and fourth place for indoor flower at the 2023 Emerald Cup. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed French Laundry, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

The general consensus surrounding Lemon Kush is that is a cross between Master Kush and Lemon Joy. However, breeder specific variations exist. Alien Genetics, for example, explains their Lemon Kush as a hybrid between Lemon G, a prized strain from Ohio, and an Afghan Kush. The genetics are the only area of dispute as everyone will agree that the sweet flavors of lemon and citrus mix exceptionally well with the earthy kush undertones. The light green buds are covered in a white frosting of trichomes and provide uplifting and creative effects. Lemon Kush is the perfect solution for when the stresses of life have you feeling sour.",

Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",
