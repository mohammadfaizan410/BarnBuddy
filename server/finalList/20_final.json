      "description": "Harvested 10/10/2023 Tangie Biscotti is a rare evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through crossing the classic (Cosmic Tangie X GSC) X GSC strains. Known for its insanely delicious flavor, Tangie Biscotti has a unique citrus cookie flavor with a lightly sour exhale. The aroma is just as delicious with a slightly sour earthy overtone that's accented by sweet and sour fruity woods and spices. The Tangie Biscotti high is just as bright as the flavor with lifted effects that start in the head before spreading to the body and leaving you utterly relaxed and at ease with the world around you. You'll feel a rush of cerebral effects at the onset that slam into your brain, knocking away any negative or racing thoughts and leaving you with pure happy haziness. As your mind slips away, a sleepy body high will wash over you, leaving you blissful and sedated, drifting off into a long and peaceful sleep. With these effects and its super high 22-25% average THC level. This bud has spade-shaped super dense and oversized olive green nugs with lots of light orange hairs and a coating of frosty tiny amber crystal trichomes.",

Supposedly a mixture of Tangie and an unknown Cookies cut, Tangie Biscotti packs an alluring fragrance of fruit, flowers, and dough. This strain’s stout effects hit hard between the eyes, leaving pleasant euphoria in the mind before turning up the physical relaxation. Prūf Cultivar says the two primary terpenes in this strain are myrcene and linalool, which speak to this strain’s more sedative sensations.  ",

      "strainDescription": "Macmosa is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Mimosa and Miracle Alien Cookies, or MAC. This strain is 50% sativa and 50% indica. Macmosa is a rare and exclusive strain from Leafwerx, a cannabis company that focuses on organic and sustainable cultivation practices. Macmosa is 19-28% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for experienced cannabis consumers who can handle a potent high. Leafly customers tell us Macmosa effects include feeling relaxed, happy, and euphoric. Medical marijuana patients often choose Macmosa when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, pain, and anxiety. Bred by Leafwerx, Macmosa features flavors like citrus, grapefruit, grapes, gas, and hash. The dominant terpene of this strain is limonene, which is often associated with a citrus aroma and mood-enhancing effects. The average price of Macmosa typically ranges from $40-$60 per eighth. Macmosa is a beautiful strain with tight dense buds covered in frosty trichomes. The buds have a sweet and musky cookies smell that reminds some users of Skittles candy. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed Macmosa, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Master Yoda clinched 1st Place at High Times Los Angeles Cannabis Cup in 2012, where the OG Kush and Master Kush cross was already a local favorite.

Its name is only loosely tied to Garlic Bud's aroma, which smells a lot more like tangy musk and spice than anything you'd throw in your stir fry. This pungent-smelling indica expresses a duality of effects: heavy body effects that crush insomnia and pain coupled with an invigorating cerebral buzz. A 7 or 8 week flowering time is all Garlic Bud needs to reach full maturation, finishing with sizeable yields.",

      "description": "2023 High Times Cannabis Cup Winner\n50 mL (1.7 fl oz) bottle with dosing measurements on dropper\n‭500 mg of full-spectrum nano-emulsified THC\nFast-acting and water-soluble for a 10 minute activation time\nMango flavored\nAll our products are cruelty-free\nVegan\nChill out faster. Nano Chill is a fast-acting, water-soluble, nano-emulsified elixir with 500 mg of full-spectrum THC. It’s crafted with indica to provide a mellow, full-body high. With an unprecedented 10-minute activation time and a tropical mango flavor, Nano Chill is the ultimate recipe for carefree days and laid-back nights.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a water-soluble, nano-emulsified elixir and a standard tincture?\n\nNo tincture or elixir on the market is just cannabis. It’s cannabis extract mixed into a base—either water or a carrier oil. Our tinctures are made with coconut oil as a base. Cannabis extract, which is also an oil, doesn’t like to mix with water, but it will happily integrate with a carrier oil. If you put standard cannabis extract in water, it would eventually separate and float to the top (because oil is less dense than water). However, to make our elixirs, we nano-emulsify the cannabis extract, mixing at extremely high speeds until the molecules become smaller and easier to mix. That’s why our water-based elixirs don’t separate over time.\n\nWill I have a different experience taking a nano elixir instead of a standard tincture?\n\nWe expect that you will! There are a few advantages of water-soluble, nano-emulsified elixirs. You may have heard the term “bioavailibility” floating around. Basically, bioavailability is amount of cannabis that actually enters your system (as opposed to just passing through and getting urinated out with no effect). Our nano elixirs have a higher bioavailability than a standard oil-based tincture because human bodies are made of mostly water, so it’s easier for us to absorb water-based products. Also, because the cannabis particles are smaller (which is what we mean by “nano”), they can pass into your bloodstream more easily than bigger, bulky particles. When you take a nano elixir, you will feel the effect much more quickly (in about 10 minutes rather than 45-60). You will also feel a greater effect for the given dose. For example, a 5 milligram dose of elixir may provide as strong of a psychoactive effect as an 8 milligram dose of tincture. Finally, some people prefer the mouth-feel and taste of a water-based elixir, which is lighter and less viscous.\n\nWhat dose should I take?\n\nEvery person and body is different. Each full dropper contains 10 milligrams of THC, so if you don’t yet know your THC limits, we recommend you start with a smaller amount—try between 2.5 and 5 milligrams. Wait at least 30 minutes for the tincture to take effect before taking more. Listen to your body and have fun!\n\nHow do I use an elixir?\n\nGreat question! Once you’ve measured out your dose, you can either squirt the tincture directly into your mouth or add it to a drink of your choice. You can also take it sublingually, which is a fancy word for “under your tongue.” Just squirt the dropper underneath your tongue, hold it there for 60 seconds, and swish it around before swallowing. This will allow some of the cannabinoids to absorb into your bloodstream more quickly and efficiently.",

Our Clinical Strength Relief Stick packs a punch in a portable container. Plus, you can apply it without getting your hands sticky. That comes in handy when you’re wearing gloves, eating Cheetos, or watching Finger Painting with Bob Ross on YouTube.\r\nWill it make me feel high?\r\n\r\nNope. Our relief stick is not psychoactive. Because the cannabinoids in topicals aren’t absorbed into the bloodstream, they won’t make you feel high.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the difference between a relief stick and a lotion or balm?\r\n\r\nRelief sticks are convenient. Portable and potent, our relief sticks come in twist-up containers so that your hands stay clean and dry while you apply the topical. The consistency is richer and thicker than a lotion, which means it soaks in more slowly but has more staying power.\r\n\r\nWhy is the potency number on my label different from what I see on your website/what was on my last product?\r\n\r\nHave you noticed that some topical companies always list the same THC and CBD potency numbers on their products? This is a red flag.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe potency of full-spectrum extract varies slightly from batch to batch, as do topicals made with full-spectrum extract. Other concentrated cannabis products—like distillate THC—produce consistent potency numbers, but at what cost? Distillates strip cannabis down to its most basic—and least useful—form. Unlike distillate, full-spectrum extract uses the whole cannabis plant and preserves all the healthful compounds. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe use full-spectrum extract in our topicals. The potency numbers on our website are targets, and as such, the unique numbers printed on each label might be slightly higher or lower depending on the batch.\r\nBeeswax is a natural occlusive—an ingredient that traps water on your skin to keep it hydrated. We’re not gonna say it’s the bee’s knees, but we’re not not gonna say that, either.\r\n\r\nSunflower oil is rich in vitamin E and moisturizing fatty acids.\r\n\r\nBenzoin essential oil is said to be an anti-inflammatory agent with skin-soothing benefits. We think it smells like sweet, natural vanilla.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur full list of ingredients is on the outside of each container.",
