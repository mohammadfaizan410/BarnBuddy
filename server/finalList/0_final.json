With its balance of indica &amp; sativa, this strain produces a euphoric high accompanied by strong feelings of relaxation. Consumers who have smoked Gelato say the effects of the strain come on quickly. You'll be left feeling numb to pain, relaxed, but mentally stimulated and productive. As far as potency goes, Gelato boasts a THC level of 21%, making it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief for pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high THC tolerance will delight in the heavy-handed effects this strain offers. In terms of taste, Gelato is sweet and features fruity and creamy flavors and aromas. According to growers, this strain produces buds that bloom in dark purple hues and are illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shiny white coating of crystal resin. The average price per gram of Gelato is $12. Because Gelato has reached a legendary status among cannabis connoisseurs, it comes as no surprise it's been used to make a variety of other high-quality Gelato strains, including Gelato #3, Gelato #33, Gelato #41, and Gelato #45.",

With its balance of indica &amp; sativa, this strain produces a euphoric high accompanied by strong feelings of relaxation. Consumers who have smoked Gelato say the effects of the strain come on quickly. You'll be left feeling numb to pain, relaxed, but mentally stimulated and productive. As far as potency goes, Gelato boasts a THC level of 21%, making it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief for pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high THC tolerance will delight in the heavy-handed effects this strain offers. In terms of taste, Gelato is sweet and features fruity and creamy flavors and aromas. According to growers, this strain produces buds that bloom in dark purple hues and are illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shiny white coating of crystal resin. The average price per gram of Gelato is $12. Because Gelato has reached a legendary status among cannabis connoisseurs, it comes as no surprise it's been used to make a variety of other high-quality Gelato strains, including Gelato #3, Gelato #33, Gelato #41, and Gelato #45.",

Reviewers on Leafly say this strain makes them feel sleepy, giggly, and hungry. The flavor of this strain may remind you of diesel with floral and pine undertones. Runtz Cake is 18% THC and 1% CBG. The dominant terpene in this strain is caryophyllene, which is often associated with spicy flavor profiles. Medical marijuana patients sometimes buy this strain when experiencing mild episodes of anxiety. The original breeder of Runtz Cake is unknown.",

Having two sons who helped pioneer the medicinal CBD market in Oregon, little did she know that she would also be dedicating her life to cultivating the healing properties of CBD products. \r\n\r\nWith the growing success her sons were having and being a perennial gardening business owner herself, Mama Lou joined the farm. And boy are we glad she did. Instantly filling a motherly role not only to the many farmhands but to the plants on the farm as well, Mama Lou quickly became affectionately known as Mama to all around. \r\n\r\nAfter her own scare with breast cancer and having experienced a dear friend’s successful battle with the disease, a passionate dedication to share all that she learned blossomed.\r\n\r\nMama Lou developed her own methods, refining the techniques of juicing leaves and was often found cooking up a fresh batch of RSO on the kitchen stove.\r\n\r\nToday Mama Lou’s specifically formulated ayurvedic tincture blends and CBD rich flower are helping to heal a nation.",

      "strainDescription": "Bubba Kush, also known as \"BK,\" \"Bubba,\" and \"Bubba OG Kush\" is an indica marijuana strain that has gained notoriety in the US and beyond for its heavy tranquilizing effects. Sweet hashish flavors with subtle notes of chocolate and coffee come through on the exhale, delighting the palate as powerful relaxation takes over. From head to toe, muscles ease with heaviness as dreamy euphoria blankets the mind, crushing stress while bringing happy moods. Bubba Kush exhibits a distinctive, bulky bud structure with hues that range from forest green to pale purple.\n\nBubba’s stocky plant stature and bulky bud structure suggest Afghani descent, but its genetic origins aren’t certain. The breeder whom this strain was named after states that Bubba Kush emerged just after 1996, when an OG Kush pollinated an unknown indica strain obtained in New Orleans. The mother plant was supposedly Northern Lights, but the genetically ambiguous indica was simply called “Bubba.” Bubba Kush has flourished from its California roots ever since.\n\n ",

      "strainDescription": "Kandy Kush, also known as \"Candy Kush,\" is a hybrid marijuana strain and a favorite of DNA Genetics’ Reserva Privada line that combines two California classics, OG Kush (thought to be the “Christopher Wallace” cut) and Trainwreck, to make a tasty indica-dominant hybrid (although sativa phenotypes displaying more of the Trainwreck structure have been noted). Like the name suggests, the flavor is sweet like candy with a strong lemon-Kush scent. Popular with medicinal growers, Kandy Kush provides a potent body high with pronounced pain relief.",

This raw oil then gets refined through a machine called a short path where all fats, lipids, waxes, chlorophyll, and terpenes are stripped out leaving a very thick oil at around 96-98% THC. To reach the correct viscosity so that the oil is smooth and burns well out of each cartridge the oil is cut with a proprietary organic oil blend as well as the unique terpene profile added for each flavor of desired fruit. This leaves each individual cartridge with a THC level of anywhere between 58-62%. The terpenes used to reach the desired flavor for Fruitlust are all derived from organic fruit or organic botanicals to create the perfected flavor of each desired fruit.",

This sweet, tropical confection-flavored cultivar came to market in the 2010s. According to the story, the cultivar came from an individual dubbed Gas Station Bob. Working as Terp Hogz, the growers Fields and Tony Mendo popularized Z with the help of 3rd Gen Family's Brandon Parker—growing the strain, entering it into contests, and making new crosses. The Original Z won 1st Place at the 2016 Emerald Cup, the 2023 King of Z Hill, and has placed in several Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Both Terp Hogz and 3rd Gen Fam—as well as other breeders—continue to refine the varietal.  In 2023, Terp Hogz announced they will use the name \"The Original Z,\" as part of a settlement with a candy company over alleged trademark infringement.  This strain features medium-sized, spongy green colas that with a sweet, tropical blend of fruit flavors. The effects of The Original Z are calming, leaving consumers focused, alert, and happy while relaxing the body to help unwind any time of day.",

Sweet hashish flavors with subtle notes of chocolate and coffee come through on the exhale, delighting the palate as powerful relaxation takes over. From head to toe, muscles ease with heaviness as dreamy euphoria blankets the mind, crushing stress while bringing happy moods. Bubba Kush exhibits a distinctive, bulky bud structure with hues that range from forest green to pale purple.\n\nBubba’s stocky plant stature and bulky bud structure suggest Afghani descent, but its genetic origins aren’t certain. The breeder whom this strain was named after states that Bubba Kush emerged just after 1996, when an OG Kush pollinated an unknown indica strain obtained in New Orleans. The mother plant was supposedly Northern Lights, but the genetically ambiguous indica was simply called “Bubba.” Bubba Kush has flourished from its California roots ever since.\n\n ",

This raw oil then gets refined through a machine called a short path where all fats, lipids, waxes, chlorophyll, and terpenes are stripped out leaving a very thick oil at around 96-98% THC. To reach the correct viscosity so that the oil is smooth and burns well out of each cartridge the oil is cut with a proprietary organic oil blend as well as the unique terpene profile added for each flavor of desired fruit. This leaves each individual cartridge with a THC level of anywhere between 58-62%. The terpenes used to reach the desired flavor for Fruitlust are all derived from organic fruit or organic botanicals to create the perfected flavor of each desired fruit.",

With a name like Twisted Citrus, you might anticipate the tropical fruity aromas even before opening your stash jar. A bold fusion of oranges and banana flavors overwhelm the inhale and fade to subtle earthiness on the release. Next comes the upbeat, energized cerebral euphoria coupled with mellow, uplifting body effects, sensations that you can appreciate any time of the day.",

Its name is derived from its aroma, which the breeder likens to a mixture of grape cough syrup, fruity hard candy, and lemon-lime soda.  ",
