With its balance of indica &amp; sativa, this strain produces a euphoric high accompanied by strong feelings of relaxation. Consumers who have smoked Gelato say the effects of the strain come on quickly. You'll be left feeling numb to pain, relaxed, but mentally stimulated and productive. As far as potency goes, Gelato boasts a THC level of 21%, making it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief for pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high THC tolerance will delight in the heavy-handed effects this strain offers. In terms of taste, Gelato is sweet and features fruity and creamy flavors and aromas. According to growers, this strain produces buds that bloom in dark purple hues and are illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shiny white coating of crystal resin. The average price per gram of Gelato is $12. Because Gelato has reached a legendary status among cannabis connoisseurs, it comes as no surprise it's been used to make a variety of other high-quality Gelato strains, including Gelato #3, Gelato #33, Gelato #41, and Gelato #45.",

      "description": "A little treat before bed is never a bad thing, and if you enjoy strains that mellow you out in the best way possible, Purple Animal Cookies might be right up your alley. Said to be bred by CannaVenture Seeds, this low profile strain is a cross between Animal Cookies and LVPK. Her Cookie genetics shine through beautifully, making her a must-try for recreational and medical users alike.\n\nThere’s a fair bit of mystery that surrounds Purple Animal Cookies, and narrowing down her potency is just the tip of the iceberg. Many will describe that these beautifully colored nugs offer a strong high, so we’d guess that she’s near, if not exceeds, the 20% mark. Although her moniker would lead one to believe that her flavors and aromas are intensely sweet, this note only comes through a little bit and blends with earth and trees for a balanced experience. While many indica-dominant hybrids are great at imparting feelings of relaxation, Purple Animal Cookies takes that concept to another level. Right off the bat, users will notice every muscle in their body softening and as you sink into sedation, your mood will soar. Happiness runs through you from head to toe and while you won’t necessarily feel the need to shout it from the rooftops, you and your couch will know that euphoria is alive and well. Prepare to fall asleep with this strain, especially if you continue to enjoy her throughout the evening. Individuals who struggle with depression and anxiety are often looking for ways to get happy and stay there, making Purple Animal Cookies an ideal option. Not only is this bud great for addressing mental woes but you can count on her to help with a wide range of physical issues too. Relaxation is so prevalent that nearly any type of physical pain will be subdued, including migraines, symptoms of arthritis, and more. Again, depending on how large of a dose you choose, this strain can offer significantly strong effects. Assuming you can locate this bud at your neighborhood dispensary, Purple Animal Cookies might easily become one of your new favorite strains. Clear your calendar, grab a blanket, and pace yourself with this intensely sedating gal - no matter what happened during the day, you’ll be able to wipe the slate clean and fall asleep with a smile on your face.",

Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead.",

Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

Because of the rising popularity of this cannabis strain, it's no surprise Runtz was named Leafly Strain of the Year in 2020. Runtz is celebrated for its creamy smoke that is smooth and welcoming. This strain of weed produces euphoric highs and uplifting effects that are known to be long-lasting. Purple Caper Seeds released the same cross under the name Gelato Zkittlez.",

      "description": "Tangieland is a cute strain with a cute name, rare and evenly balanced between Indica and Sativa. The flavor is addictingly delicious despite coming with a pretty sour flavor. This is a strain for those who love citrus flavors, spicy herbs, and the taste of sweet earth. The high is incredible and the soothing effects come not only with mood improvements but also reduced inflammation.\n\nA few hits in, Tangieland becomes a place where you can experience renewed creative energy (and reduced pain). If you have art projects or writing you need to finish, Tangieland can provide a welcome escape from the grind, calm down your stress, and treat chronic conditions. The plant itself has unique arrowhead-like nugs with soft, almost invisible amber trichomes. It was bred by Crockett Family Farms as a cross between Tangie and Candyland, reasonably enough. The result inherits flavors from both sides of the family. The overwhelming flavor at first is of a soft, sugary candy with the zing of a citrus tang flavor and the scent of pine trees. There’s an overtone of herbal spiciness as well that increases as the nugs are burned, turning into an earthy, outdoorsy haze. That’s when the creative energy kicks in. You won’t be sinking and sleeping in Tangieland – you’ll be bouncing off your couch and ready to put in the creativity to get your day started. That’s why we recommend trips to Tangieland during the daytime only, time when you can be aware of the tingly relaxation, the pain relief, and the alertness. The effects most effectively treated with Tangieland include chronic pain, depression, inflammation, spasms, and fatigue. If you find that your work gives you headaches or migraines in the evening, probably accompanied by fatigue, Tangieland can help you. The classic tingling energy of this balanced strain encourages a sense of clear-headed awareness and focus. You’ll feel cerebral and introspective, ready to tackle your day with a more unified self.\n\nThe effects of Tangieland are uplifting and the flavors help with that. The candied orange, sweet herbs, and earth flavors would make anyone feel great, even if they aren’t used to intense cannabis strains. Reaching THC levels up to 20%, Tangieland isn’t a record-breaker or a slump either. It’ll get the job done, no matter your experience level. It’s easy to remember Tangieland’s name once you focus on the candy flavors and citrus sweetness. If you use it, you’ll remember the sense of cerebral, creative calm even more. ",

The flower is compact, light green in color, and generally covered in orange hairs. Huckleberry plants have a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and produce average yields. They might be a bit tricky for the novice grower. The effects of this strain are on the milder side and largely reported as relaxing, cutting through stress without the cloudiness. Undoubtedly, this strain is best known for its intense fruity smell and taste, similar to its relative Blueberry.",

Green and purple hues weave through the buds beneath a crystalline layer of trichomes, from which sprout Phantom Cookies’ electric orange hairs. Its aroma is an intricate blend of earthiness and roasted nuts, accented by sweeter notes of grape and berry. Next comes this hybrid’s crushing euphoria which shakes the mind awake with creativity and happiness. Increase the dose and the brain and body will be overcome with a relaxing haze that dulls nausea, stress, and pain while sharpening the appetite. Phantom Cookies will be ready to harvest outdoors at the beginning of October, but indoor growers will wait 8 to 9 weeks for buds to finish flowering.",

Lava Cake produces deeply relaxing effects that ease the mind and body. This strain is ideal for after work, lazy days off, or for anyone seeking to relax. Lava Cake is widely celebrated for its deliciously sweet flavor profile that puts out exceptionally smooth and cakey terpenes. Consumers say this strain smells similar to freshly baked goods - with notes of sugary dough coming through. Medical marijuana patients choose Lava Cake for swift relief of symptoms associated with chronic pain, stress and anxiety. Growers say this strain grows in a dense, bulbous structure with rich hues of purple and green camouflaged by dense, glistening trichomes.",

Larry OG produces a potent yet easy body buzz that will allow you to relax while getting things done. The effects of Larry OF are happy but not overwhelming. Like other members of the OG family, this strain has a very clean and piney aroma. The nugs tend to be dense and feature distinct burnt orange hairs that are longer than average.",
