    "description": "**Prices on Leafly do not include tax. Final cost will be given at pickup**\n\nAt Top Crop, we’re all about lifting one another up, supporting our community, and living life on a higher level. Begun in 2018 by a couple of high school friends chasing their cannabis-infused dream of creating a top-tier shop that takes care of every customer, Top Crop has since grown to become one of the most trusted names in the Oregon cannabis industry. Both customers and vendors alike can’t get enough of the experience and premium product selection available at all three Top Crop locations throughout Oregon.\n\nWhile our main jam is providing the best value on the most expansive selection of flower, concentrates, carts and edibles around, we are about a whole lot more than helping folks get high. It’s our goal to help customers learn more about this incredible plant and how it works within our bodies. We’re here to help educate enthusiasts, advance the industry as a whole, and destigmatize—and normalize—cannabis use in all of its forms.",

      "strainDescription": "Tiger Moon is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Tiger's Milk and Starfighter. This strain is a well-balanced hybrid, combining qualities from both its indica and sativa parent strains. Tiger Moon is composed of approximately 50% sativa and 50% indica genetics, resulting in a harmonious and versatile cannabis experience. Tiger Moon is the result of crossing the relaxing effects of Tiger's Milk with the potential mood-enhancing qualities of Starfighter. With a THC content that typically ranges between 18% and 22%, this strain is suitable for both beginners and experienced cannabis consumers who appreciate a moderate level of potency. According to Leafly customers, the effects of Tiger Moon include a sense of euphoria and relaxation. Users often report feeling uplifted and creative, with a gentle body sensation that doesn't lead to excessive sedation. This balanced high makes Tiger Moon suitable for various activities and times of the day. Medical marijuana patients often choose Tiger Moon to address symptoms associated with conditions such as stress, anxiety, and mild pain. The strain's mood-enhancing effects can provide relief from emotional distress, while its potential relaxation may alleviate physical discomfort and tension. Bred by Bodhi Seeds, Tiger Moon features a flavor profile that may include earthy and woody notes from its Tiger's Milk lineage, as well as the sweet and fruity undertones of Starfighter. This combination of flavors adds depth to the overall experience of consuming Tiger Moon. The dominant terpene found in Tiger Moon is likely to be myrcene, contributing to its potential relaxing effects and earthy aroma. The average price of Tiger Moon can vary depending on location and dispensary, but it typically falls within the mid to higher price range. Tiger Moon's balanced effects, complex flavor profile, and potential therapeutic benefits have established it as a notable hybrid strain in the cannabis community. If you've had the opportunity to consume Tiger Moon, consider sharing your insights and experiences by leaving a strain review.",

Jet Fuel is the ultimate cross of some of the most renowned Diesel strains, offering a THC level of 20%. By combining Aspen OG with High Country Diesel, we are left with a hybrid that flowers within 9-10 weeks and that stays true to the influence of SFV OG Kush and East Coast Sour Diesel in its lineage. Jet Fuel's name isn't purely devoted to the sweet, pungent aroma of diesel fumes this strain exudes. It also indicates a high-energy jolt of uplifting effects that will eventually level off and lull you into a dream-like state of relaxation.",

      "strainDescription": "Afghan Kush's roots trace back to the Hindu Kush mountain range near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It has been perfected over centuries, making it the ultimate source for hash such as charas and the sticky black Afghani hash. White Label Seed Company, a Sensi Seeds partner from the Netherlands, made its seeds available for everyone to grow. The buds of Afghan Kush develop into massive, blunt-topped nuggets full of resin and coming in big yields. Revered for its heavy resin content and powerfully sedating effects, Afghan Kush is a top choice for anyone looking to relax after a long day.",

Effects take off fast, giving many consumers a strong buzz. Immediate effects tend to be active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. It tends to smooth into a more focused state to allow for normal activities, and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. A popular variant of this strain crosses a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa from the breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild flavor. In 2022, Cypress Hill rapper B-Real's 'Insane' brand also released a strain named Cherry Bomb, that's a Zkittlez x Cherry Pie cross.",

      "strainDescription": "Creamsicle is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Orange Crush and Juicy Fruit strains. This strain has a loud citrus flavor and aroma that resembles a creamsicle with a hint of vanilla. Creamsicle is 28% THC and 1% CBG, making this strain an ideal choice for experienced cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us Creamsicle effects include uplifted, happy, and energetic. Medical marijuana patients often choose Creamsicle when dealing with symptoms associated with anxiety, stress, and depression. Bred by Terraform Genetics, Creamsicle features flavors like orange, vanilla, and citrus. The dominant terpene of this strain is myrcene. The average price of Creamsicle typically ranges from $10-$15 per gram. This strain is very frosty compared to most CBD strains and has a unique aroma of cherries and orange peels. Creamsicle buds have a dense structure similar to that of Girl Scout Cookies and are ready for harvest after a flowering cycle of 50-55 days. This strain won 1st place for “Best CBD Flower” at the 2016 High Times Cannabis Cup in Los Angeles and 2nd place for “Best CBD Concentrate” at the 2016 High Times Concentrate Cup. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed Creamsicle, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with depression and stress. Mimosa is a staple from the Tangie family. Breeder Symbiotic Genetics has released a refined Mimosa dubbed Mimosa v6.",

      "strainDescription": "Blue Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Blueberry with Haze. This strain produces a balanced high, along with effects such as cerebral stimulation and full-body relaxation. Blue dream is 18% THC but has a low CBD percentage, making this potent strain a fan favorite of both novice and veteran cannabis consumers. In terms of flavor, Blue Dream is reported to smell and taste like sweet berries. Medical marijuana patients often use Blue Dream to treat symptoms of depression, chronic pain, and nausea. Blue Dream originated in California and has since achieved legendary status among West Coast strains and has quickly become one of the most-searched-for strains in the Leafly database. The average price per gram of Blue Dream is $20. Strains similar to Blue Dream include Blue Dream CBD, Double Dream, and Blue Magoo.",
