    "description": "At Montana Kush our philosophy is that there's only one way to grow, which is through 100% natural cultivation. Many of our competitors prioritize volume thus running large operations which require a regular pesticide regiment. Here, we're different! We care about the medicinal quality of our plants above all else. We've found the best way to maximize the medicinal properties of cannabis is to keep grow rooms small so that each plant gets the individual attention it needs. We've always prioritized quality above all else, and that will never change.\n\nMontana Kush is locally owned and operated in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. We live in a place that's perfect and pristine, and we plan on keeping it that way. We are both stewards of the land and protectors of our environment. These values are reflected in the way that we run our business and plan for the future.\n\nWe are also exceptionally proud that we employ local residents throughout the state of Montana. Our business would be nothing without our team, and we can't emphasize how fundamental they are in everything we do.So next time you're in the shop be sure to hug the budtender!",

Its buds are the bright, swampy green of Yoda himself or a green lightsaber, with orange hairs and abundant golden trichomes. The effects of Baby Yoda are believed to be sedating and tingly. Reviewers on Leafly say this weed strain makes them feel aroused, uplifted, and focused, but it wonât team you up with a Mandalorian. Baby Yoda has 24% THC. The dominant terpenes are myrcene and caryophyllene, which give off a diesel, tobacco-laced nose with sweet notes. Medical marijuana patients say they buy Baby Yoda for help with stress. The original breeder of Baby Yoda is Compound Genetics.",

The result was a hybrid with a unique terpene profile that boasts a complex aroma with notes of fuel, skunk,Â and spice. OG often refers to âOriginal Gangster,â indicating either the strainâs authenticity or intensity. Â OG Kush should smell like lemon-pine-fuel with a high-THC, mixed head and body effect. It's often enjoyed in the back half of the day to ease stress.  The genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, OG Kush arrived in Los Angeles in 1996 when Matt âBubbaâ Berger brought it (along with âThe Bubba,â which was later used to create the famed Bubba Kush) from Florida to legendary cultivator Josh D. Since then, OG Kush has become a worldwide staple used to create numerous famous strains like GSC and Headband. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush weed, including Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Ghost OG.",

Known for possessing a relaxing yet intensely euphoric high, it is also described as having a âcreeperâ effect as well as pronounced appetite enhancement.",

Bubble Gum is 17% THC, and its potencyÂ is deal for both new and experienced cannabis consumers. In small doses, this strain can be enjoyed throughout the day. In large doses Bubble Gum can dry out your mouth, so make sure you have adequate hydration available while you partake. This strain features a flavor profile reminiscent of its namesake, with bubble gum and sweet floral flavors bursting through. Medical marijuana patients choose Bubble Gum to relieve symptoms associated with disorders like chronic pain, nausea, stress, and depression. The average price per gram of Bubble Gum is $10. Bubble Gum was originally bred by growers in Indiana and has been winning cannabis awards since 1994, including countless Cannabis Cups.",
