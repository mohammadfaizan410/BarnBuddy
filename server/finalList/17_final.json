This strain is beloved by many consumers for its energizing effects. But donât let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crackâs sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\"Â perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a âCâ) or Green Cush instead.",

This strain pairs well with evening activities but could also be used for stimulating conversation among friends. The popular Horchata in 2022 comes from Compound Genetics, though WyEast Genetics also sells crosses of it.",

The result was a hybrid with a unique terpene profile that boasts a complex aroma with notes of fuel, skunk,Â and spice. OG often refers to âOriginal Gangster,â indicating either the strainâs authenticity or intensity. Â OG Kush should smell like lemon-pine-fuel with a high-THC, mixed head and body effect. It's often enjoyed in the back half of the day to ease stress.  The genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, OG Kush arrived in Los Angeles in 1996 when Matt âBubbaâ Berger brought it (along with âThe Bubba,â which was later used to create the famed Bubba Kush) from Florida to legendary cultivator Josh D. Since then, OG Kush has become a worldwide staple used to create numerous famous strains like GSC and Headband. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush weed, including Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Ghost OG.",
