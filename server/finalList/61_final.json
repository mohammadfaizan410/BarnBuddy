      "description": " Green Crack, also known as \"Green Crush\" and \"Mango Crack,\" is a potent sativa marijuana strain made by crossing Skunk #1 with an unknown indica. This strain is beloved by many consumers for its energizing effects. But don’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis. Few strains compare to Green Crack’s sharp energy and focus as it induces an invigorating mental buzz that keeps you going throughout the day. With a tangy, fruity flavor redolent of mango, Green Crack is a great daytime strain that may help consumers fight fatigue, stress, and depression. Because the name \"Green Crack\" perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a ‘C’) or Green Cush instead. Animal Face, also known as \"Animal Face #10,\" is a rare sativa-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Face Off OG and Animal Mints. It takes the piney, gassy terpene profile and potent high from Face Off OG and pairs it with the cookie-flavored smoothness of Animal Mints. Animal Face weed is known for giving a full mind and body-numbing high that lets you drift off into physical and mental bliss. Bred by the famed Seed Junky Genetics, Animal Face took first place in the 2022 Emerald Cup Awards.",

      "description": "Expect a major blow to the head from this super-potent strain. A pure sativa, Durban Poison is the beloved inbred descendant of a sativa strain grown in South Africa. Ed Rosenthal, an American cannabis activist, discovered the original strain and brought in back to the United States in the 1970s. It has long been a favorite of stoners and medical marijuana patients here. Durban Poison has THC levels that can reach 24%, making it one of the world's more powerful strains. This strain hits with a strong, happy head high that's great for creativity and daytime errands. Paranoia may be a possible side effect, along with dry mouth. Durban Poison is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety, as well as chronic pain, and it can also be helpful with nausea. This strain is ideal for making concentrates, as the bud is covered in over-sized trichomes. The dominant smell and taste of Durban Poison is earthy and sweet, with a subtle pine aroma. The buds are round and chunky, with a dense coating of trichomes. This strain is best for active periods, chores, and other daylight activities.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Energizing, Euphoria, Focus, Happy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Headaches, Migraines, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nCitrus, Herbal, Pine, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Pine, Pungent, Spicy, Sweet\r\n",

Crescendo has a very mellow and smooth smoke, featuring the combined powers of a Chem Dawg strain, I-95 strain, and Mandarin Cookies cross. The flavor comes straight from its Chem Dawg heritage, with a strong taste of diesel and earth and a hint of citrus. The strong Sativa lean makes this a suitable morning or daytime smoke. The cerebral effect is pronounced, with a hazy and uplifting trip into the clouds that is mentally active but not overly intoxicating.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Ethos Cookies #16, the father strain, is lauded for its unique balance of cerebral invigoration and physical tranquility. With a fragrant profile that conjures up images of fresh berries with hints of earthy undertones, it’s an aromatic delight that’s as therapeutic as it is flavorful.",

Platinum Cookies buds have dense dark olive green nugs with dark amber hairs and a super thick coating of tiny bright white crystal trichomes that cover each and every inch of the nugs. The aroma of Platinum Cookies is a lot like the flavor, although it does take on a heavy musky effect that's pretty fragrant and pungent. The Platinum Cookies high is every bit as enjoyable as the classic GSC high but with amplified effects. It starts with a euphoric boost that lifts your spirits and leaves you feeling happy and completely at ease. As your mind soars through bliss, your body will fall victim to a tingly body buzz that leaves you utterly relaxed and completely at ease. Because of these effects and its powerful 18-26% average THC level, Platinum Cookies is often chosen by patients who need sweet relief from conditions such as chronic anxiety or stress, nausea, and migraines or tension headaches.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Relaxing, Uplifting\r\nMay Relieve \r\nAnxiety, Chronic Pain, Migraines, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nCandy, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nBerry, Dank, Musky, Nutty, Spicy, Sweet",

      "description": "Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Cerebral, Euphoria, Happy, Relaxing, Sleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nAnxiety, Arthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Headaches, Inflammation, Insomnia, Migraines, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Grape, Herbal, Pine, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Pine, Pungent, Spicy",

This flavorful bud is said to be the grandfather of all weed strains, packing timeless full-bodied effects and an infamous flavor that will leave you begging for more. The Granddaddy Purple high hits you first with a cerebral rush that leaves you feeling completely euphoric although with a slight numbing effect. A slightly psychedelic effect will slowly wash over your mind, leaving it floating through trippy visions as your body falls into a deep sense of relaxation and peace. With effects like these and a powerful 20-27% THC level and almost 1% average CBD level, Granddaddy Purple is the perfect bud for killing the effects of chronic pain, muscle spasms, insomnia, and appetite loss. This bud has a super sweet grape flavor that has a heavily pungent harsh aftertaste that can overwhelm some. The aroma is pretty powerful with hints of sweet grape and berry accented by a heavy spicy pungency that's pretty harsh in itself, too. Granddaddy Purple buds are strikingly purple, spattered with bright fiery orange hairs and coated in sweet sticky resin.\r\nEffects\r\nCerebral, Euphoria, Happy, Hungry, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nArthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Migraines, Muscle Spasms, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Fruity, Grape, Pine, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nBerry, Earthy, Grape, Sweet",

      "description": "Kush mint\r\nKush Mint is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through a potent cross of the classic Bubba Kush X Animal Mints strains. Perfect for any fan of a super minty flavor, Kush Mint brings on well-balanced effects that hit both mind and body with a high level of potency thanks to its super heavy 22-24% average THC level. Kush Mint has a fabulously sharp minty taste with hints of fresh coffee and earthy cookies to it. The aroma is of earthy sweet woods and rich spicy coffee with a heavy kick of mint. The Kush Mint high isn't quite as eye-opening as the flavor, with relaxing effects that will have you kicking back and pretty sleepy if you're not careful. It starts with a warming tingle in the spine, filling you with a sense of deep permeating relaxation that ebbs and flows outwards through your limbs until you are totally calm in both mind and body. With these effects and its high level of potency, Kush Mint is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, depression, chronic fatigue and nausea or appetite loss. This bud has fluffy oversized piecey forest green nugs with rich amber undertones, matching hairs and a coating of sparkling clear crystal trichomes.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Hungry, Relaxing, Tingly, Uplifting\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Nausea\r\nFlavors\r\nCoffee, Herbal, Sweet, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nCoffee, Earthy, Herbal, Spicy, Woody\r\n\r\nZKittlez is an indica dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the deliciously powerful Grape Ape X Grapefruit strains. Although the exact indica to sativa ratio varies based on breeder practices, ZKittlez has been measured consistently at having a low THC level of 15%. Despite this relatively mild THC level, this bud placed first for Best Indica at both the 2015 Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Despite its low THC level, this bud packs a powerful flavorful punch. ZKittlez has a super fruity aroma of sweet tropical earth with a slight herbal effect to it. The flavor is even better, with a sweet berry taste that has a crisp tropical citrus aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after you finish smoking. The ZKittlez is just as enticing as its taste, although it is relatively mellow in nature. It starts with an uplifting head buzz that leaves you euphoric and creatively inspired but not anxious or overwhelmed. This is accompanied by a relaxing body buzz that slowly spreads throughout the body and to your very fingertips, leaving you completely calm and pain free without limiting your movement. A mild sleepy effect will wash over you upon the comedown, although it won't put you to sleep. These effects make ZKittlez the perfect choice for treating patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, mild cases of depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and inflammation. This bud has large and lumpy pepper-shaped dark olive green nugs with sparse rich amber hairs and a thick frosty coating of tiny crystal white trichomes.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Focus, Happy, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Cancer, Chronic Pain, Depression, Headaches, Inflammation, Insomnia, Migraines, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Citrus, Grape, Grapefruit, Sweet, Tropical\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Fruity, Herbal, Sweet",

Aurora Borealis grows into a medium size plant similar to Skunk#1, and has a sweet and fruity taste with a hashy sharpness. Very high yields and a fast maturation time make this cross an ideal cash-cropper both indoors and out. The subtle, calming effects have helped this strain gain popularity in the Netherlands and Canada with its sweet, skunky flavors and earthy undertones.",

      "description": "Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Euphoria, Happy, Relaxing, Sleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nAnxiety, Arthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Headaches, Inflammation, Insomnia, Migraines, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Grape, Herbal, Pine, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Pine, Pungent, Spicy",

Perfect for any fan of a super minty flavor, Kush Mint brings on well-balanced effects that hit both mind and body with a high level of potency thanks to its super heavy 22-24% average THC level. Kush Mint has a fabulously sharp minty taste with hints of fresh coffee and earthy cookies to it. The aroma is of earthy sweet woods and rich spicy coffee with a heavy kick of mint. The Kush Mint high isn't quite as eye-opening as the flavor, with relaxing effects that will have you kicking back and pretty sleepy if you're not careful. It starts with a warming tingle in the spine, filling you with a sense of deep permeating relaxation that ebbs and flows outwards through your limbs until you are totally calm in both mind and body. With these effects and its high level of potency, Kush Mint is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, depression, chronic fatigue and nausea or appetite loss.

As you pull apart each greasy little nugget, aromas of spicy skunky diesel and sugary fruits are released, all wrapped up with a savory herbal sage overtone. The flavor is just as unique, with a sugary sweet fruity taste accented by skunky sage and spicy diesel. The Grease Bucket high will wash over you with warming waves of elation, lifting your spirits and settling your body before easing you off to sleep. You'll feel spacey and a little out of touch with reality, although super happy about it. A relaxing body buzz will help your physical form settle down before inching its way into your brain and lulling you to sleep. Combined with its high 23-26% average THC level, these effects make Grease Bucket a great choice for treating chronic pain, headaches or migraines, ADD or ADHD and muscle spasms or cramps.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Focus, Happy, Relaxing, Sleepy, Uplifting\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Chronic Pain, Cramps, Headaches, Migraines, Muscle Spasms\r\nFlavors\r\nFruity, Skunky, Sour, Spicy, Sugary, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nDiesel, Earthy, Fruity, Herbal, Sage, Skunky, Spicy",

Kush Mint has a fabulously sharp, minty taste with hints of fresh coffee and earthy cookies. The aroma is of earthy, sweet woods and rich, spicy coffee with a heavy kick of mint. The Kush Mint high is less eye-opening than the flavor, with relaxing effects that will have you kicking back and sleepy if you're not careful. It starts with a warming tingle in the spine, filling you with a sense of deep relaxation that ebbs and flows outwards through your limbs until you are calm in mind and body.\r\nZKittlez is an Indica-dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the deliciously potent Grape Ape X Grapefruit strains. ZKittlez has a super fruity aroma of sweet tropical earth with a slight herbal effect to it. The flavor is a sweet berry taste that has a tropical citrus aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. It starts with an uplifting head buzz that leaves you euphoric and creatively inspired but not anxious or overwhelmed. This is accompanied by a relaxing body buzz that slowly spreads throughout the body and to your very fingertips, leaving you completely calm and pain-free without limiting your movement.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Hungry, Relaxing, Tingly, Uplifting, Focus, Happy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Nausea, Headaches, Insomnia\r\nFlavors\r\nCoffee, Herbal, Sweet, Woody, Tropial\r\nAromas\r\nCoffee, Earthy, Herbal, Spicy, Woody, Fruity, Sweet\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The THC levels, which can top 20%, make this a particularly potent choice for those seeking stress reduction and mood boost. The high is predominantly relaxed, both in body and mind, but the sativa component adds a strong euphoria and feelings of happiness. This strain is often used to treat anxiety, chronic pain, and insomnia, while it's also helpful in treating depression, ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and PMS. Negative effects most commonly include dry mouth and dry eyes, with a limited possibility of dizziness. An inbred descendant of the OG Kush strain, Tahoe OG has an earthy, lemony taste, with a pungent plant smell. This strain is most popular on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan. It's usually found in California, where it was initially bred near Lake Tahoe. It isn't the easiest strain to find, but the potency alone is worth the effort. Tahoe OG can grow well indoors or out, and its vegetative cycle is of moderate length, about 70 days.\r\nEffects\r\nSleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite\r\nFlavors\r\nLemon, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Lemon, Pine, Pungent, Woody\r\n",

A top nighttime strain, it provides an extremely lazy, heavy body sensation. Due to superb breeding, Tahoe OG embodies all of the typical indica effects with an added euphoric, sativa-like kick. This strain features an earthy, lemon taste, and is a phenotype of OG Kush. Maturing at around 10 weeks, Tahoe OG is a must-try for those looking for a great night’s sleep.",

This strain provides the best aspects of both sativa and indica, and the high is powerful, happy, and euphoric, but with couch-lock body effects and feelings of lethargy. GSC tastes sweet and earthy, and it smells much the same. It's most effective at treating anxiety, stress, and depression, though it's also good for appetite. Dry mouth is the only likely adverse effect, though others are possible. This strain began as a crossbreed of OG Kush and a near-even hybrid; (Durban Poison X F1). GSC first appeared in California and is now one of the most popular strains in North America, where sells best on the West Coast and in Michigan. The high lasts for hours, making GSC a good deal in most places. It can be difficult to grow, but it's fast becoming a staple among home cultivators.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Pain, Depression, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Migraines, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nCherry, Lemon, Mint, Sweet, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Nutty, Pungent, Spicy, Sweet, Vanilla\r\n",
