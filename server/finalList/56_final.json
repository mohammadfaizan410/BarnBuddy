These classic OG aromas blend nicely with medical-grade body effects that lean toward the sedative side with the addition of Face Off OG genetics. Those who smoke Dosi can enjoy a stoney, in-your-face buzz off the start that melts down over the body, prettifying the consumer with relaxation that emanates outward. The dominant terpene in Dosidos is limonene.",

As the name indicates, this OG Kush relative originates from California’s San Fernando Valley. Although their names are barely distinguishable, SFV OG Kush is actually the Afghani-crossed child to SFV OG. Leading with aromatic notes of earthy pine and lemon, its body effects take a little longer to feel than the initial head haziness.",

This cross began in 2006 with the combination of SFV OG and Larry OG, and evolved over a laborious process of identifying the best phenotypes to breed forward. By 2009, Vader OG had become a mainstay of the Ocean Grown Seeds roster and gave way to several new OG crosses. The terpene profile is rich with pinene, spice, and hash. Vader OG’s effects are euphoric while remaining strongly indica-dominant, locking consumers to their seat. Its effects are ideal for curbing pain and stress, but may also be used as a sleep aid in the proper dosage. ",

      "strainDescription": "OG Kush, also known as \"Premium OG Kush,\" was first cultivated in Florida in the early ‘90s when a marijuana strain from Northern California was supposedly crossed with Chemdawg, Lemon Thai and a Hindu Kush plant from Amsterdam. The result was a hybrid with a unique terpene profile that boasts a complex aroma with notes of fuel, skunk, and spice. OG often refers to “Original Gangster,” indicating either the strain’s authenticity or intensity.  OG Kush should smell like lemon-pine-fuel with a high-THC, mixed head and body effect. It's often enjoyed in the back half of the day to ease stress.  The genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, OG Kush arrived in Los Angeles in 1996 when Matt “Bubba” Berger brought it (along with “The Bubba,” which was later used to create the famed Bubba Kush) from Florida to legendary cultivator Josh D. Since then, OG Kush has become a worldwide staple used to create numerous famous strains like GSC and Headband. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush weed, including Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Ghost OG.",

Its light-colored buds are densely packed and sugar-coated with a delicious fruity and floral terpene profile. People may expect a potent and powerful high from this candy-flavored strain. Archive continues to heavily refine the Moonbow line, and in 2022 released Moonbow #112 IX (which crosses Moonbow #112 F1 x Moonbow #112 F2 #60).",

      "strainDescription": "Caffeine is a sativa-dominant hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between Northern Lights and Columbian Gold. This strain showcases a genetic composition that is approximately 70% sativa and 30% indica, resulting in a stimulating and uplifting cannabis experience. With a THC content that typically ranges between 15% and 20%, this strain can cater to both beginners and experienced cannabis consumers who desire a moderate to moderately high potency. Leafly customers tell us the effects of Caffeine include an initial burst of energy and heightened focus. This often transitions into a feeling of euphoria and uplifted mood, making Caffeine an ideal choice for daytime activities and productivity. The sativa-dominant nature of the strain contributes to its invigorating effects, which can help combat fatigue and promote a sense of mental clarity. Medical marijuana patients often turn to Caffeine for relief from symptoms associated with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and lack of focus. The strain's mood-enhancing effects, combined with its potential to increase alertness and motivation, can provide a sense of mental relief and vitality. Additionally, Caffeine's potential to reduce stress and promote a positive outlook on the day can be particularly beneficial for managing mood-related challenges. Caffeine features a flavor profile that combines elements of its parent strains. Users often describe a mix of earthy and herbal flavors with hints of citrus and pine. This complex flavor experience adds to the overall enjoyment of consuming Caffeine. The dominant terpene found in Caffeine is limonene, contributing to its potential mood-enhancing effects and citrusy aroma. The average price of Caffeine can vary depending on location and dispensary, but it typically falls within the mid to higher price range. Caffeine's energizing effects and potential therapeutic benefits have positioned it as a notable sativa-dominant hybrid strain in the cannabis community. If you've had the opportunity to try Caffeine, consider sharing your insights and experiences by leaving a strain review.",

As the name indicates, this OG Kush relative originates from California’s San Fernando Valley. Although their names are barely distinguishable, SFV OG Kush is actually the Afghani-crossed child to SFV OG. Leading with aromatic notes of earthy pine and lemon, its body effects take a little longer to feel than the initial head haziness.",
