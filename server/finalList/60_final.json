      "description": "Durban Dew has a unique and complex terpene profile with a pungent aroma with sweet and fruity notes. Her taste is smooth, sweet and sour & berry-like. Durban Dew is the ideal strain for lovers of an active and clear Sativa up-high. This THC-rich photoperiod cannabis strain has an energetic and uplifting high. It activates the brain and provides a strong head-high. This is an ideal strain for those who like a Sativa effect without paranoia. But be aware that smoking a high dose can also lead to strong narcotic and sedative effects.\r\n\r\nThe clear yet potent mental high is what positively surprised our test team. The initial effect is uplifting, clear, social and creative. Despite getting stoned, you are able to remain very active. The high is euphoric and long lasting. This is the perfect strain for a party or concert. This is definitely not a couch lock strain. The soft, sweet-sour fruity taste lets you enjoy yourself and this combination of terpenes with the cannabinoids provides a pleasant high that makes you float wonderfully.",

If you're looking for a super bright flavor and a loud high, you've found it! Mandarin Cookies pack a sharp, tangy citrus flavor with hints of rich nutty herbs upon exhale, almost like an almond cookie! The aroma is earthy and cozy, with a sour tangerine overtone that turns slightly pungent as the nugs are burned. The Mandarin Cookies high is just as eye-opening as the flavor, with a lifted high that hits both mind and body with an almost frantic sense of energy and motivation. You'll feel a rush of euphoria first that fills your mind with a sense of tingly creativity and energy. Soon, this effect will push out negative or racing thoughts, leaving you slightly unfocused without affecting your energy. This is accompanied by a light, relaxing body that keeps your limbs calm without causing sedation. With these effects and its high 19-26% average THC level, Mandarin Cookies is perfect for treating those suffering from chronic pain, depression, headaches or migraines, ADD or ADHD, and chronic fatigue. This bud has elongated pepper-shaped olive green nugs with thick yellow-orange hairs and tiny, frosty white crystal trichomes coating.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Relaxing, Tingly, Uplifting\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Headaches\r\nFlavors\r\nCitrus, Herbal, Orange, Sour\r\nAromas\r\nCitrus, Earthy, Herbal, Orange, Sour",

      "description": "Crescendo comes from the winning seed of a batch bred by Ethos Genetics from Denver, Colorado. Crescendo has a very mellow and smooth smoke, featuring the combined powers of a Chem Dawg strain, I-95 strain, and Mandarin Cookies cross. The flavor comes straight from its Chem Dawg heritage, with a strong taste of diesel and earth and a hint of citrus. The strong Sativa lean makes this a suitable morning or daytime smoke. The cerebral effect is pronounced, with a hazy and uplifting trip into the clouds that is mentally active but not overly intoxicating.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Ethos Cookies #16, the father strain, is lauded for its unique balance of cerebral invigoration and physical tranquility. With a fragrant profile that conjures up images of fresh berries with hints of earthy undertones, it’s an aromatic delight that’s as therapeutic as it is flavorful.",

      "description": "Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands.\r\nEffects\r\nBody High, Cerebral, Euphoria, Happy, Relaxing, Sleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nAnxiety, Arthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Headaches, Inflammation, Insomnia, Migraines, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Grape, Herbal, Pine, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Pine, Pungent, Spicy",

      "description": "This homage to the comic book legend could turn even the Incredible Hulk into a mild-mannered everyman. It's powerfully relaxing, with sativa-dominant genes (60:40 sativa/indica ratio) that deliver a massive dose of THC: Nearly 29% in some tests. That makes this a holy grail of sorts for patients seeking the strongest high. CBD contents, however, are low, so this is not an ideal choice for conditions that respond to that chemical. The head high is intensely euphoric, combined with strong creativity and a whole-body mood boost. Energy levels are high, making this a good daytime strain. Bruce Banner is a highly effective painkiller, but it's also good for anxiety, depression, nausea, and sleeplessness. Dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are both common side effects, along with occasional paranoia and dizziness. The dominant flavor is sweet, with notes of citrus and a strong, pungent smell. The bud has a heavily frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous glands. It's most popular in Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon, though it can be found elsewhere. Expect this strain to increase in popularity thanks to its high THC concentrations.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Energizing, Euphoria, Happy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Arthritis, Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Headaches, Insomnia, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Diesel, Strawberry, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nDiesel, Floral, Pungent, Strawberry, Sweet\r\n",

Bruce Banner might be best known as the alter-ego of comic book hero The Incredible Hulk, but maybe he wouldn't be such a stressed-out ball of anger if he just had some of his namesake weed strain. Bruce Banner is potent, averaging a 21% THC level. If you're new to smoking Bruce Banner, expect the effects to be strong and to come on quickly before dissipating into a euphoric and creative high. The effects of Bruce Banner will linger in the head and may provide body relaxation. Bruce Banner is a bud best enjoyed during the daytime. This strain was originally bred by Dark Horse Genetics from a cross of OG Kush and Strawberry Diesel. Bruce Banner buds offer a diesel aroma with sweet undertones. This strain does have three main phenotypes, one of which is Bruce Banner #3.  The dominant terpene of Bruce Banner is myrcene.",

It has long been a favorite of stoners and medical marijuana patients here. Durban Poison has THC levels that can reach 24%, making it one of the world's more powerful strains.

Durban Poison is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety, as well as chronic pain, and it can also be helpful with nausea.

It gives an exceptionally sweet aromatic essence and a fruity flavor. The taste is a perfect combination of sweetness of cookies and fruitiness of a cherry pie. It works as a calming agent and appetite stimulator, and is quite helpful for patients who experience regular depression-associated syndromes, fibromyalgia, MS and other such related symptoms. It may act as a sedative for patients, but does help in calming down nerves or controlling anxiety stimulating symptoms. Although it might not completely hamper your focus and energy levels, it will cause the usual drying out of eyes and mouth. This particular medical marijuana is grown indoors. It is observed to contain a THC level of 25-27%. In terms of physical features, it is shaped like pine trees and looks dense in its structural form. It is quite frosty looking and has dark green leaves. This particular medical marijuana is also thickly dressed up with orange hair all over it. It is most generally known for its sugary taste, as well as high potency value.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Relaxing, Sleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Depression, Fibromyalgia, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Multiple Sclerosis, Nausea\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Fruity, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nSweet",

It has a fruity berry aroma with a CBD level of 0.73 per cent and high levels of THC: 15-20%. It belongs to the Indica variety of strains and is farmed in the UK. Cheese is a useful pain reliever and calming agent that also help in overcoming chronic symptoms of extreme depression and body aches. It is important to note that this specific strain may prove a little too heavy for beginners, causing throbbing headaches, head spins and even anxiety attacks. Still, these symptoms are not particularly harmful; they are common in the initial period of intake. They may experience its positive effects immediately after the initial symptoms wear off, which takes a few hours at most. Although this medical marijuana strain may prove to be too much for beginners, it significantly helps in rationally placing its medical benefits and special effects into the limelight of a favorable environment.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Happy, Hungry, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nArthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Insomnia, Migraines, Nausea, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nButtery, Cheesy, Creamy, Skunky, Sweet, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nCheese, Earthy, Herbal, Pungent, Sweet",

Cheese has achieved widespread popularity for its unique flavor and consistent potency. With origins that stretch back to the late 1980s, Cheese is said to descend from a Skunk #1 phenotype whose pungent aroma made it stand out. Breeders like Big Buddha Seeds later introduced Afghani indica genetics to increase Cheese’s trichome production and yields. The resulting strain is now well-known for its relaxed, happy effects that gently ease you into a blissful state of mind.",

This is believed to be the phenotype of 'Granddaddy Purple'. However, this is most frequently referred to be the specific phenotype of 'Mendocino Purps'. This strain is identified by its purple nugs covered by longer orange hairs. Physically, purple urkle is typical of an indica strain and is shorter, thicker and bushier. This is another clone-only strain dedicated to Californian dispensaries. This strain is found to best grown indoor than outdoor. The aroma of this strain is skunky with minute hints of fruity aroma. With the THC and CBD of 18-21% and 0.36%, respectively, this strain tastes like grapes and sweet berries. The strong physical buzz given by this strain would alleviate the symptoms of muscle spasms, anxiety and nausea. The users of this strain reported that the indicia effects of this strain thoroughly relax and sleep-inducing.

Bred from Deep Breath (father) and Ice Cream Cake (mother) resulting in a dense, sticky, trichome heavy flower.

The come up is quick and heady and has staying power but isn't uncomfortable The high slows you down in the best way with full body relaxation and is ideal for pain management with the high ratio of indica.

      "description": "This homage to the comic book legend could turn even the Incredible Hulk into a mild-mannered everyman. It's powerfully relaxing, with sativa-dominant genes (60:40 sativa/indica ratio) that deliver a massive dose of THC: Nearly 29% in some tests. That makes this a holy grail of sorts for patients seeking the strongest high. CBD contents, however, are low, so this is not an ideal choice for conditions that respond to that chemical. The head high is intensely euphoric, combined with strong creativity and a whole-body mood boost. Energy levels are high, making this a good daytime strain. Bruce Banner is a highly effective painkiller, but it's also good for anxiety, depression, nausea, and sleeplessness. Dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are both common side effects, along with occasional paranoia and dizziness. The dominant flavor is sweet, with notes of citrus and a strong, pungent smell. The bud has a heavily frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous glands. It's most popular in Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon, though it can be found elsewhere. Expect this strain to increase in popularity thanks to its high THC concentrations.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Energizing, Euphoria, Happy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Arthritis, Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Headaches, Insomnia, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Diesel, Strawberry, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nDiesel, Floral, Pungent, Strawberry, Sweet",

American Pie is best known for its well-balanced full-body effects that relax and stimulate you simultaneously without being too overpowering. This is surprising considering its high THC level, which typically hits the 20% mark on average. The American Pie high starts with a cerebral onset that strikes you almost immediately after taking a few minutes, leaving you feeling uplifted and happy yet relaxed and at ease. As this high builds, a slightly buzzy body high will ebb throughout your limbs, easing away any aches or pains without weighing your body or mind down. These well-balanced effects give American Pie an edge in treating various conditions, including chronic pain, migraines, chronic stress or anxiety, and irritability. The American Pie flavor is one for the ages – tastes of sweet citrus are accented by subtly spicy grass and a hint of rich pine. The aroma is slightly sweet and spicy, with a fresh sandalwood overtone accented by herbs and hay. American Pie buds have tiny, compact, and dense neon green nugs with sparse orange hairs and a coating of chunky white crystal trichomes.\r\nEffects\r\nHappy, Uplifting\r\nMay Relieve \r\nAnxiety, Chronic Pain, Depression, Migraines, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nCitrus, Spicy\r\nAromas\r\nCitrus, Grassy, Spicy",

      "description": "Tahoe OG offers a powerful mix of heady india and body-oriented sativa, with a 10:90 sativa/indica ratio. The THC levels, which can top 20%, make this a particularly potent choice for those seeking stress reduction and mood boost. The high is predominantly relaxed, both in body and mind, but the sativa component adds a strong euphoria and feelings of happiness. This strain is often used to treat anxiety, chronic pain, and insomnia, while it's also helpful in treating depression, ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and PMS. Negative effects most commonly include dry mouth and dry eyes, with a limited possibility of dizziness. An inbred descendant of the OG Kush strain, Tahoe OG has an earthy, lemony taste, with a pungent plant smell. This strain is most popular on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan. It's usually found in California, where it was initially bred near Lake Tahoe. It isn't the easiest strain to find, but the potency alone is worth the effort. Tahoe OG can grow well indoors or out, and its vegetative cycle is of moderate length, about 70 days.\r\nEffects\r\nSleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite\r\nFlavors\r\nLemon, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Lemon, Pine, Pungent, Woody\r\n",

      "strainDescription": "Tahoe OG, also known as \"Tahoe OG Kush,\" is the perfect rainy day marijuana strain. Strong and fast-acting, you may not want to use this strain when you’re planning to leave the house. Great for those suffering from insomnia, pain, or lack of appetite, Tahoe OG has made a name for itself among other indicas. A top nighttime strain, it provides an extremely lazy, heavy body sensation. Due to superb breeding, Tahoe OG embodies all of the typical indica effects with an added euphoric, sativa-like kick. This strain features an earthy, lemon taste, and is a phenotype of OG Kush. Maturing at around 10 weeks, Tahoe OG is a must-try for those looking for a great night’s sleep.",

      "description": "Cheese is a vibrant emerald-coloured bud of relaxing medical marijuana, which is brightened by florescent orange hair that covers the bud. It has a fruity berry aroma with a CBD level of 0.73 per cent and high levels of THC: 15-20%. It belongs to the Indica variety of strains and is farmed in the UK. Cheese is a useful pain reliever and calming agent that also help in overcoming chronic symptoms of extreme depression and body aches. It is important to note that this specific strain may prove a little too heavy for beginners, causing throbbing headaches, head spins and even anxiety attacks. Still, these symptoms are not particularly harmful; they are common in the initial period of intake. They may experience its positive effects immediately after the initial symptoms wear off, which takes a few hours at most. Although this medical marijuana strain may prove to be too much for beginners, it significantly helps in rationally placing its medical benefits and special effects into the limelight of a favorable environment.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Happy, Hungry, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nArthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Fatigue, Insomnia, Migraines, Nausea, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nButtery, Cheesy, Creamy, Skunky, Sweet, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nCheese, Earthy, Herbal, Pungent, Sweet",

Cheese has achieved widespread popularity for its unique flavor and consistent potency. With origins that stretch back to the late 1980s, Cheese is said to descend from a Skunk #1 phenotype whose pungent aroma made it stand out. Breeders like Big Buddha Seeds later introduced Afghani indica genetics to increase Cheese’s trichome production and yields. The resulting strain is now well-known for its relaxed, happy effects that gently ease you into a blissful state of mind.",

This strain can reach THC levels of up to 28%, meaning it's one of the most potent strains available to medical marijuana patients. This strain provides the best aspects of both sativa and indica, and the high is powerful, happy, and euphoric, but with couch-lock body effects and feelings of lethargy. GSC tastes sweet and earthy, and it smells much the same. It's most effective at treating anxiety, stress, and depression, though it's also good for appetite. Dry mouth is the only likely adverse effect, though others are possible. This strain began as a crossbreed of OG Kush and a near-even hybrid; (Durban Poison X F1). GSC first appeared in California and is now one of the most popular strains in North America, where sells best on the West Coast and in Michigan. The high lasts for hours, making GSC a good deal in most places. It can be difficult to grow, but it's fast becoming a staple among home cultivators.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Relaxing\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Pain, Depression, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Migraines, Nausea, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nCherry, Lemon, Mint, Sweet, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Nutty, Pungent, Spicy, Sweet, Vanilla\r\n",

This popular strain is known for producing euphoric effects, followed up by waves of full-body relaxation. One hit of GSC will leave you feeling happy, hungry, and stress-free. This strain features a robust THC level of 19% and is best reserved for experienced cannabis consumers.

The high THC content in GSC is beloved by medical marijuana patients looking for quick relief from symptoms associated with chronic pain, nausea, and appetite loss. GSC is famous for its pungent, dessert-like aroma &amp; flavor profile featuring bold notes of mint, sweet cherry, and lemon. The average price per gram of GSC is $11. This strain has won numerous accolades and awards over the years, including a few Cannabis Cups. Because GSC has reached legendary status among the cannabis community at large, you can find many variations of this sought-after strain, including Thin Mint (aka Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies) and Platinum GSC (aka Platinum Girl Scout Cookies).",

You bred from Deep Breath (father) and Ice Cream Cake (mother), resulting in a dense, sticky, trichome-heavy flower.

The aroma is a room filler, not the strain you accidentally want to leave in your coat if you're going to eat dinner at the Caucus Club. Ice Cream Cake's luscious, earthy flavors come through in a big way on the smoke with lingering dank. The come-up is quick, heady, and has staying power but isn't uncomfortable. The high slows you down in the best way with full body relaxation and is ideal for pain management with the high ratio of India. Deep Fried Ice Cream is also exceptional fuel for creativity and muted focus. A stay-home and chill or end-of-the-night smoke.

      "description": "Tahoe OG offers a powerful mix of heady india and body-oriented sativa, with a 10:90 sativa/indica ratio. The THC levels, which can top 20%, make this a particularly potent choice for those seeking stress reduction and mood boost. The high is predominantly relaxed, both in body and mind, but the sativa component adds a strong euphoria and feelings of happiness. This strain is often used to treat anxiety, chronic pain, and insomnia, while it's also helpful in treating depression, ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and PMS. Negative effects most commonly include dry mouth and dry eyes, with a limited possibility of dizziness. An inbred descendant of the OG Kush strain, Tahoe OG has an earthy, lemony taste, with a pungent plant smell. This strain is most popular on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan. It's usually found in California, where it was initially bred near Lake Tahoe. It isn't the easiest strain to find, but the potency alone is worth the effort. Tahoe OG can grow well indoors or out, and its vegetative cycle is of moderate length, about 70 days.\r\nEffects\r\nSleepy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nChronic Pain, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite\r\nFlavors\r\nLemon, Spicy, Woody\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Lemon, Pine, Pungent, Woody\r\n",

A top nighttime strain, it provides an extremely lazy, heavy body sensation. Due to superb breeding, Tahoe OG embodies all of the typical indica effects with an added euphoric, sativa-like kick. This strain features an earthy, lemon taste, and is a phenotype of OG Kush. Maturing at around 10 weeks, Tahoe OG is a must-try for those looking for a great night’s sleep.",

This is believed to be the phenotype of 'Granddaddy Purple'. However, this is most frequently referred to be the specific phenotype of 'Mendocino Purps'. This strain is identified by its purple nugs covered by longer orange hairs. Physically, purple urkle is typical of an indica strain and is shorter, thicker and bushier. This is another clone-only strain dedicated to Californian dispensaries. This strain is found to best grown indoor than outdoor. The aroma of this strain is skunky with minute hints of fruity aroma. With the THC and CBD of 18-21% and 0.36%, respectively, this strain tastes like grapes and sweet berries. The strong physical buzz given by this strain would alleviate the symptoms of muscle spasms, anxiety and nausea. The users of this strain reported that the indicia effects of this strain thoroughly relax and sleep-inducing. Hence, this will be an ideal bedtime strain for those who are fighting insomnia.\r\nEffects\r\nCreative, Euphoria, Happy\r\nMay Relieve \r\nADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Arthritis, Chronic Pain, Depression, Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Migraines, Nausea, PTSD, Stress\r\nFlavors\r\nBerry, Fruity, Grape, Skunky, Sweet\r\nAromas\r\nEarthy, Fruity, Grape, Skunky, Sweet",
