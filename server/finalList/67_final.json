      "description": "A sativa dominant hybrid between the ever-popular MK Ultra and Chemdawg 91, Cold Creek Kush, or CCK, is a globally recognized strain, known for its light green hues, amber hairs, and trichrome-frosted flowers. CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

Warlock buds are characteristically dense and pepper shaped with emerald green hues with sparse thick furry orange hairs dusted with a fine sweet sticky layer of nearly translucent trichomes. This magical strain achieves a THC level from 20-26% with a terpene profile that includes caryophyllene, myrcene and bisabolol which showcase its earthy skunky origins while elevated by its fragrant fruity sweet and sour nuances. Warlock by Redecan is further improved upon through the care and attention given to each plant through every stage of growth, harvest and curing that is complemented by being expertly hand trimmed to ensure high quality in every batch. Warlock is now available in 1g, 3.5g and 28g formats.\n\n",

      "strainDescription": "White Widow is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica. This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Reviewers on Leafly.com say Frosty is often used for stress, anxiety, and depression. The dominant terpene of Frosty is myrcene. The original breeder of this strain is currently unknown.",

Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness.

Warlock buds are characteristically dense and pepper shaped with emerald green hues with sparse thick furry orange hairs dusted with a fine sweet sticky layer of nearly translucent trichomes. This magical strain achieves a THC level from 20-26% with a terpene profile that includes caryophyllene, myrcene and bisabolol which showcase its earthy skunky origins while elevated by its fragrant fruity sweet and sour nuances. Warlock by Redecan is further improved upon through the care and attention given to each plant through every stage of growth, harvest and curing that is complemented by being expertly hand trimmed to ensure high quality in every batch. Warlock is now available in 1g, 3.5g and 28g formats.\n\n",

This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Reviewers on Leafly.com say Frosty is often used for stress, anxiety, and depression. The dominant terpene of Frosty is myrcene. The original breeder of this strain is currently unknown.",

      "description": "A sativa dominant hybrid between the ever-popular MK Ultra and Chemdawg 91, Cold Creek Kush, or CCK, is a globally recognized strain, known for its light green hues, amber hairs, and trichrome-frosted flowers. CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

      "strainDescription": "White Widow is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica. This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",

Consumers who have smoked this strain say it provides a strong and happy head high. Smoking Frosty will make you feel happy and relaxed. In large doses, Frosty may make you feel sleepy. When enjoying this strain, you may want to pair it with a glass of water because Frosty has a reputation for causing dry mouth. The flavor profile of this strain is earthy and pungent with sweet undertones. According to growers, Frosty flowers into lightly frosted buds with light brown hairs throughout. Reviewers on Leafly.com say Frosty is often used for stress, anxiety, and depression. The dominant terpene of Frosty is myrcene. The original breeder of this strain is currently unknown.",

CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

This medium-sized plant has a branchy morphology and can benefit from a slightly longer vegetative cycle, leading to large, healthy colas throughout. Its bud structure helped give this strain its name, with buds resembling a large, well-fed iguana. Blue Iguana emits skunky, tar, and earthy aromas that may be challenging on the nose, but exciting on the palate.    ",

CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates.

CCK is a hard-hitting strain that tests with high THC levels, usually between 17–23%. Cold Creek Kush is recognized for its dank smell, resembling a damp rainforest with notes of earth, wood, sour, and pine. It gives a strong but fresh aroma and a dank, spicy, herbal flavour, informed by high levels of beta pinene, nerolidol, trans-caryophyllene, and limonene. Just as with any Redecan Evergreen strain, our CCK is carefully harvested, expertly cured to preserve natural flavour and moisture, trimmed by hand, and inspected. Cold Creek Kush is offered in 1g, 3.5g, 7g, 15g, and 28g of dried flower, as well as in our signature Redees pre-roll format.",

      "description": "Warlock is a storied award winning indica dominant strain that was derived through purposeful breeding and backcrossing classic strains of Skunk #1 and Afghani to extract favourable genetic traits. Warlock buds are characteristically dense and pepper shaped with emerald green hues with sparse thick furry orange hairs dusted with a fine sweet sticky layer of nearly translucent trichomes. This magical strain achieves a THC level from 20-26% with a terpene profile that includes caryophyllene, myrcene and bisabolol which showcase its earthy skunky origins while elevated by its fragrant fruity sweet and sour nuances. Warlock by Redecan is further improved upon through the care and attention given to each plant through every stage of growth, harvest and curing that is complemented by being expertly hand trimmed to ensure high quality in every batch. Warlock is now available in 1g, 3.5g and 28g formats.\n\n",

This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Bred by Green House Seeds, White Widow features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of White Widow typically ranges from $8-$12 per gram. White Widow is a balanced hybrid that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.",
