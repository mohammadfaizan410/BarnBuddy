This strain exhibits powerful, full-body effects that are elevated by a jolt of cerebral energy and carefree state of mind. Sherbet boasts a THC level of 18% and may be overwhelming to novice cannabis consumers. The high potency of Sherbert makes it an ideal choice for medical marijuana patients seeking relief from symptoms associated with stress, tension, and mood disorders. This strain features a sweet, dessert-like flavor profile with notes of skunky citrus, sweet berry, and candy. The average price per gram of Sherbert is $20, but may vary based on your location. According to growers, Sherbert flowers into oblong fluffy nugs with rich trichome coverage and dark amber hairs throughout light and dark green foliage. This strain was originally bred by Mr. Sherbinski, who bred Sherbert intentionally to inherit the genetic lineage of its parent strain Girl Scout Cookies.",

      "description": "True to its name, smelling remarkably like a fresh baked batch of Blueberry Muffins, this strain is an Indica dominant hybrid (70/30) that has a smooth, creamy, and fruity taste that is sure to provide full-bodied and cerebral effects. With an unusual terpene profile for an indica hybrid, Blueberry Muffin is high in humulene and caryophyllene, traits that it inherits from the cross between Purple Panty Dropper x Blueberry. Often used for anxiety, chronic pain and stress, Blueberry Muffin is a highly versatile strain that has been a favorite of medical and recreational users alike. \n\nSeeking all the benefits of cannabis, but need something for on-the-go, or discrete situations? Groove’s Live Rosin Cartridge offers a natural, solventless, full-spectrum experience that is as close to smoking flower as you can achieve in a vape cartridge. To make it even better, Groove researched tirelessly to find the safest and best tasting cartridge on the market.",
