      "description": "ZKittlez is an indica dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the deliciously powerful Grape Ape X Grapefruit strains. Although the exact indica to sativa ratio varies based on breeder practices, ZKittlez has been measured consistently at having a low THC level of 15%. Despite this relatively mild THC level, this bud placed first for Best Indica at both the 2015 Cannabis Cups in San Francisco and Michigan. Despite its low THC level, this bud packs a powerful flavorful punch. ZKittlez has a super fruity aroma of sweet tropical earth with a slight herbal effect to it. The flavor is even better, with a sweet berry taste that has a crisp tropical citrus aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after you finish smoking. The ZKittlez is just as enticing as its taste, although it is relatively mellow in nature. It starts with an uplifting head buzz that leaves you euphoric and creatively inspired but not anxious or overwhelmed. This is accompanied by a relaxing body buzz that slowly spreads throughout the body and to your very fingertips, leaving you completely calm and pain free without limiting your movement. A mild sleepy effect will wash over you upon the comedown, although it won't put you to sleep. These effects make ZKittlez the perfect choice for treating patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, mild cases of depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and inflammation. This bud has large and lumpy pepper-shaped dark olive green nugs with sparse rich amber hairs and a thick frosty coating of tiny crystal white trichomes.",

This tasty little bud took home 1st Place for Best Sativa in the 2008 High Times’ Cannabis Cup and for good reason – with its long lasting cerebral effects, Utopia is one powerhouse smoke. The Utopia Haze high comes on soon after you finish your first toke, hitting you with a strong cerebral lift that infuses you with a sense of hazy relaxation. As your mind lifts higher and higher, your body will start to fall into a deep body high that fills you with a heavy sense of relaxation. As your body settles into this state of calm, you’ll start to feel a sleepy haziness wash over you, lulling you into a semi-sedated state that can cause you to fall asleep. Utopia Haze is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as glaucoma or eye pressure, arthritis, migraines or headaches, and chronic pain. This bud has a sweet and spicy fruity mint flavor with a citrus herbal exhale that’s very savory. The aroma is sweet and earthy with a fruity woody overtone that becomes pungent as the nugs are burned. This bud has small piecey forest green nugs with furry orange hairs and a coating of tiny amber crystal trichomes.",

Although it is hard to find the authentic version of this particular medical marijuana strain, it definitely will not be hard to believe that this is the best type of strain. In structural composition, it has dense buds with orange hair all over and displays a slight tint of purple. Inspiring the name of this medical marijuana strain, the aroma is that of cherry pies. It is most commonly used by patients who are suffering from evident symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, migraines and other stress-oriented syndromes. Although it may cause dry eyes and mouth upon use by the patient, it definitely helps in elevating the level of euphoria, relaxing body and mind, uplifting moods and focusing the conscience. For patients who are specially looking for something that would ease muscle stiffness and related ailments, this can definitely prove its rescuing ability. Conclusively, this is the best kind of medically favorable marijuana strain that patients prefer above all others; it diminishes the above mentioned syndromes in the most relaxing order and even though sedation may cause irritation, but its value is still undeniable.",

      "description": "This famous sativa-dominant hybrid, which has an 80:20 sativa/indica ratio, combines a powerful head high with a soothing body high that last for at least two hours. Acapulco Gold originated in Acapulco, Mexico, but no one seems to remember who first grew it or what parent strains were used. Acapulco Gold is pretty hard to find because it's difficult to grow indoors, but it's popular throughout the United States, especially in warmer climes. It's best used to treat anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, but it's also good for insomnia and headaches, as well as some mental disorders. This strain can be especially powerful, with THC levels as high as 24%. It has a distinct earthy flavor and aroma, with a taste of chestnut and tealeaves. As with most strains, the most likely adverse effects are dry eyes and dry mouth. Paranoia and dizziness are also possible but less common. Acapulco Gold is most popular in the Western United States, the Upper Midwest, and the desert Southwest. It often costs more than other strains because of its potency and the beautiful gold-tinged appearance of its bud.",

This strain produces effects that are motivating and energizing. This strain comes from the area in and around Acapulco, Mexico, and its orange hairs resemble a gold nugget, with gold, green, and brown colors and plenty of resin on the buds. An aroma of burnt toffee lingers when the bud is broken up. Acapulco Gold has a reputation for being one of the best cannabis strains ever created, and it's becoming more difficult to find. ",

This bud has an insanely delicious flavor that's exactly how its name sounds – fresh sweet watermelon and delicious sugary fruits! The aroma is slightly skunky with a tropical sweet smell that's slightly hashy and fruity. The Watermelon high is just as delicious as its taste, with calming and peaceful effects that are perfect for those stressful days when you just need to kick back and relax. The onset is very euphoric and lifted with a calming effect that washes over both mind and body, leaving you completely relaxed from head to toe. These effects can come slightly at times, leaving you dozing and dropping off into long and peaceful sleep. These effects and its super-powered 29% average THC level give Watermelon an edge in treating conditions such as appetite loss, chronic stress or anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain or muscle spasms. Watermelon buds have fluffy pale green nugs with vivid pink undertones, bright orange hairs, and a coating of frosty tiny white crystal trichomes.",

The plants grow large with colorful yellow, red, and green flowers. William's Wonder offers a diverse scent that is a cross between citrus and tropical fruits. The taste is both sweet and sour. Since the 1980's, this has been a very popular strain because of the potency and great taste. It isn't one to start out with though so those new to using marijuana may want to work up to it. This type of marijuana is best used at the end of the day. Most users find it quickly encompasses them and they will drift off to sleep. If you use too much of it, a foggy type of fatigue may be present the next morning. Users who are new to William's Wonder may experience dizziness the first few times. This strain is often used to help treat insomnia and to increase appetite for those suffering from anorexia. Medically, it can be used to reduce inflammation. It has also been used to help reduce the mental effects of PTSD and depression.",

Looking for a super unique flavor? You've found it with Lemon Mints. This bud packs a sour lemony citrus taste accented by rich nuttiness and a punch in the mouth of sharp mint. The aroma is just as vibrant, with a heavy minty overtone that's accented by spicy sour citrus and a touch of earth. The Lemon Mints high isn't quite as bright as the flavor, with relaxing and giggly effects that will leave you unfocused and sedated for hours on end. You'll feel a subtle boost of mental energy that's accompanied by a heavy sense of physical sedation that leaves you fully couch-locked and pretty hungry at times. You won't be sedated in this state, but rather super lazy and really not willing to get up and move at all. Combine these effects with its high 24% THC level and 1-2% CBD level and you have the perfect recipe for treating appetite loss or nausea, depression, chronic stress, insomnia, chronic pain and mood swings. This bud has dense long forest green nugs with bright orange hairs and a coating of frosty tiny white crystal trichomes.",

This celebrity child is perfect for any indica lover, with an energizing yet spacey high that will have you feeling boosted for hours on end. The lift hits you with a creeping effect, sneaking up on you before taking hold of your mind with a tingly mental energy. This tingle will soon expand, pushing out any negative or racing thoughts and replacing them with blissful haziness. Throughout this lifted euphoric state, your body will stay anchored with a buzzy couchlock that doesn't cause too much sedation, but rather serves to keep you pain-free and kicked back. With these effects and its super high 23-24% average THC level, Chronic Widow is often chosen to treat conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, depression, chronic pain, muscle spasms or cramps and inflammation. This bud has a classic spicy cinnamon flavor with a notable hint of earthy florals upon exhale. The aroma is earthy and flowery with a woody overtone that's accented by spicy cinnamon. Chronic Widow buds have fluffy spade-shaped forest green nugs with long thin orange hairs and a super thick coating of tiny vibrantly white crystal trichomes.",

This tasty little bud took home 1st Place for Best Sativa in the 2008 High Times’ Cannabis Cup and for good reason – with its long lasting cerebral effects, Utopia is one powerhouse smoke. The Utopia Haze high comes on soon after you finish your first toke, hitting you with a strong cerebral lift that infuses you with a sense of hazy relaxation. As your mind lifts higher and higher, your body will start to fall into a deep body high that fills you with a heavy sense of relaxation. As your body settles into this state of calm, you’ll start to feel a sleepy haziness wash over you, lulling you into a semi-sedated state that can cause you to fall asleep. Utopia Haze is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as glaucoma or eye pressure, arthritis, migraines or headaches, and chronic pain. This bud has a sweet and spicy fruity mint flavor with a citrus herbal exhale that’s very savory. The aroma is sweet and earthy with a fruity woody overtone that becomes pungent as the nugs are burned. This bud has small piecey forest green nugs with furry orange hairs and a coating of tiny amber crystal trichomes.",

Pineapple Express produces long-lasting energetic effects that you can feel right away. Pineapple Express is 18% THC and may make you feel buzzy, alert, and creative. The best time to smoke Pineapple Express is in the morning, afternoon, or early evening hours. In terms of flavor, this strain packs a punch to your pallet with bright citrus notes infused with pineapple and earthy pine, thanks to the terpenes of caryophyllene limonene and Ocimene. Medical marijuana patients choose Pineapple Express to relieve symptoms associated with depression, pain, and fatigue. The average price per gram of Pineapple Express is $20.",
