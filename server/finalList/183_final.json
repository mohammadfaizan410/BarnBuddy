The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

Comatose OG should have OG Kush’s dense, resinous look, piney, musky smell, and strong, THC-driven effects; this strain will only have trace levels of CBD. Sometimes abbreviated as just “Comatose,” there’s also a Coma Cookies from Enlightened Genetics that crosses GSC and Bruce Banner 2.0. And since “comatose” can describe the sleepy effects of cannabis, many things might be labeled with that moniker. Consumers report using Comatose OG for anxiety, depression, insomnia, sleep, and stress.",

      "strainDescription": "Modified Banana, also known as “Modified Bananas,” is an extremely potent hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Banana OG with GMO. The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

The effects of Modified Banana are more calming than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain tell us Modified Bananas is “the most fun high” they have ever had. Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

Common effects of Modified Banana include euphoria, relaxation, and feeling talkative. It features a banana-forward flavor profile with pungent fruity and floral aromas. Some consumers say it smells like ammonia, while others say it smells like butter. The dominant terpene in Modified Banana is myrcene, with limonene and caryophyllene as the secondary terpenes. Medical marijuana patients report this strain may provide relief from symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, and anxiety. Modified Banana pairs well with nighttime activities when you have nothing left to do but hit the hay. The THC percentage of Modified Banana is 31%, meaning this strain should only be used by experienced cannabis consumers with a high THC tolerance.",

Carmel’s version of Animal Face was selected out of 100 different phenos, not only for its high potency and terpene profile, but also because of its unique flavours of lemon and cake. Top terpenes include Limonene, Linalool, and Myrcene. These infused pre-rolls are made with Animal Face whole flower, expertly milled for the perfect burn, then introduced to solventless bubble hash and roll it up into a slow-burning blunt wrap.",
