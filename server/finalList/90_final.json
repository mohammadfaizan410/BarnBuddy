    "description": "At Montana Kush our philosophy is that there's only one way to grow, which is through 100% natural cultivation. Many of our competitors prioritize volume thus running large operations which require a regular pesticide regiment. Here, we're different! We care about the medicinal quality of our plants above all else. We've found the best way to maximize the medicinal properties of cannabis is to keep grow rooms small so that each plant gets the individual attention it needs. We've always prioritized quality above all else, and that will never change.\n\nMontana Kush is locally owned and operated in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. We live in a place that's perfect and pristine, and we plan on keeping it that way. We are both stewards of the land and protectors of our environment. These values are reflected in the way that we run our business and plan for the future.\n\nWe are also exceptionally proud that we employ local residents throughout the state of Montana. Our business would be nothing without our team, and we can't emphasize how fundamental they are in everything we do.So next time you're in the shop be sure to hug the budtender!",

Its buds are the bright, swampy green of Yoda himself or a green lightsaber, with orange hairs and abundant golden trichomes. The effects of Baby Yoda are believed to be sedating and tingly. Reviewers on Leafly say this weed strain makes them feel aroused, uplifted, and focused, but it won’t team you up with a Mandalorian. Baby Yoda has 24% THC. The dominant terpenes are myrcene and caryophyllene, which give off a diesel, tobacco-laced nose with sweet notes. Medical marijuana patients say they buy Baby Yoda for help with stress. The original breeder of Baby Yoda is Compound Genetics.",

The White is covered with so many white trichomes that buds look like they were rolled in confectioner’s sugar. While it looks much like an OG in structure and certainly has the potency associated with the best OG Kush cuts, it has little of the smell or flavor found in those West Coast favorites. Those who do not enjoy the flavor and aroma of cannabis opt for this strain over more pungent varieties. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with insomnia.",

Its buds are the bright, swampy green of Yoda himself or a green lightsaber, with orange hairs and abundant golden trichomes. The effects of Baby Yoda are believed to be sedating and tingly. Reviewers on Leafly say this weed strain makes them feel aroused, uplifted, and focused, but it won’t team you up with a Mandalorian. Baby Yoda has 24% THC. The dominant terpenes are myrcene and caryophyllene, which give off a diesel, tobacco-laced nose with sweet notes. Medical marijuana patients say they buy Baby Yoda for help with stress. The original breeder of Baby Yoda is Compound Genetics.",
