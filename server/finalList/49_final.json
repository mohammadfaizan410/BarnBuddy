      "description": "If you need to re-center yourself and you don't have time for a full-on yoga session, then Blue Runtz is the next best thing. It creates a moment of serenity that allows you to walk, untouched, through the eye of the hurricane and emerge ready to handle whatever awaits you on the other side.\n\nStart your aromatherapy by holding the nugs up to your nose and taking a long deep inhale. Allow yourself to be transported to a mostly-sunny day in mid-spring, when the flowers are in full bloom and the berries are just starting to ripen on the vine. It tastes like springtime with sugary notes of vanilla, sprinkled with citrus flavors like blueberry and pear. This delicate floral bouquet is best appreciated with the aid of a bong or a water-filtered vaporizer, otherwise you might miss out on some of the subtler notes.\n\nWhile you're indulging in the lipsmackingly-good flavors, the Blue Runtz high settles in like river water around an eddy. By the time you lift your head to check out your surroundings, you'll find yourself filled with a serene euphoria, feeling creative but unfocused, without a care in the world, but ready to re-engage with it. \n",

      "description": "You can tell that Eugreen Farms is just as interested in making their flower taste good as they are in ensuring you get the kind of high you want. This Grandi Candi will leave you feeling fine and dandy, and it has just the most delightful flavor.\nGrandi Candy is surprisingly sweet and fruity, like smoking a flavored blunt but without any of the tobacco. You'll get notes of berries so fresh you can almost taste them and a citrusy overtone that makes everything feel new and clean. It's perfect just on its own, whether ground up in a bowl or rolled into a joint, although we recommend using a vaporizer if you're here for the terpenes.\nWhen it comes to the effect, Grandi Candi has that classic weed vibe of letting you just settle into yourself for a minute. As soon as you hit it, you'll feel it in your eyes, then the calm comes in like the tide. Grandi Candi can be overwhelming for people who are new to Mary Jane, but the worst that happens is they get the best nap of their life. It's not the kind you wake up groggy from either—just smoke less next time.",

It combines some obscure strains, Lemon Cherry Gelato x (E85 x Doggie Bag), for a balanced hybrid smoke that satisfies any sweet tooth. Grandi Candi buds grow compact in a bright purple that can even veer pink, with green accents and stringy orange hairs; heavy trichomes also give them a wet, shiny look. Like a bag of Skittles, the Grandi Candi palate can range from sweet to sour terps, apple to cherry with diesel undernotes.

This is a very versatile strain that bends and flexes however you need it, with balanced effects that make it suitable for daytime or nighttime use.\n\nMac Daddy will transport you to an alternate reality where everything is the same except you—you're calm, centered, and ready for anything. Just the smell of the flower alone is like rejuvenating aromatherapy. Its scent is full of butter and a lingering hint of banana, like a busy restaurant that bakes their own banana bread for brunch every day.\n\nThe buds are frosted like an apple cider donut, and you can spot that Granddaddy Purple lineage if you look closely. That's also where Mac Daddy gets its restorative properties. It seeps deep into your joints for a tension-eliminating body high. MAC#1, the other parent, boosts the optimistic side of your imagination, making even the most irritating problems seem understandable, comprehensible, and conquerable. We recommend using a vaporizer and some kind of water filter, as the smoke sometimes hits a little harsh (it's the caryophyllene.)",

Medical marijuana patients often choose Mac Daddy when dealing with symptoms associated with pain, anxiety, and depression. Bred by Local Flower, Mac Daddy features flavors like nutty, earthy, and pepper. The dominant terpene of this strain is unknown. The average price of Mac Daddy typically ranges from $30-$50 per eighth. Mac Daddy has a pungent spicy taste and a skunky aroma that will fill the room.

You can probably smell it from here. It's hard to say whether the lemon or the cardamom comes through most, but either way, it's a sensory enchantment. Crumble a little bit under your nose for a little sample of what's in store.\nThe other thing to appreciate about Lemon Cherry Dosido is it has light, springy nugs cling to each other while still leaving little pockets of air. It practically rolls itself into a joint or a blunt wrap. With terpenes like this, you're better off using a vaporizer and a water filter. It just tastes too good to combust!\nThe effects of Lemon Cherry Dosido are almost immediate. It's like moving to the window seat in the café when there's a break in the clouds—warm and invigorating—the kind of moment you just want to soak in. Unless you know you have low tolerance, in which case this is kind of a heavy strain. One hit may be sufficient, so it helps to have some friends to share the love.",

Obama Runtz first appeared as a one-off mention on a video that blew up in 2020, then it made its way into a few Atlanta-based rappers' bars before anyone had the chance to create a strain that could live up to the name. The good news for us is that Grown Rogue has done just that.\n\nObama Runtz is just the strain to reignite your hope for change. It's bred from a triple cross between Runtz, OG Kush, and Afghani, so its parents are basically Obama Kush and Runtz. The buds are dark and dense with layers of bright forest greens and little oases of deep purple. Obama Runtz has trichomes that are so sparkly you'll want to make sure your flash is off if you try to take pictures of it, otherwise it will be blinding.\n\nIt smells down-to-earth with a spicy, floral aroma, and it hits smooth. Obama Runtz has a clear, calming high that will make you feel chatty and confident, perfect for working the room or drumming up support for your latest campaign. It's also great as a party pre-game strain, ideal for smoothing over scene transitions.\n",

It's named for basketball player Gary \"The Glove\" Payton who became a nine-time NBA All-Star and Hall of Famer after being an All-American at Oregon State. He wore number 20, and this strain was the twentieth phenotype of a cross between The Y and Snowman.\n\nThe best offense is a good defense, and there's nothing directly offensive about this strain. Gary Payton has a rich, spicy flavor that harbors hints of sweetness beneath its herbal diesel exterior. You might get a little bit of mint and nutmeg on the exhale, but it's not a cougher.\n\nThe high from Gary Payton is fast, hard-hitting, and long-lasting. It brings on an immediate hit of euphoria and giggles that translate to increased energy. This is a great strain for combatting the Instant Gratification Monkey.",

What is this Super Buff Cherry stuff, and how did Utokia pull it off?\nWhen you finally get the smoke (or vapor, preferably filtered through a cooling chamber,) into your lungs, you'll discover that all of that sensory overload was only the overture.

Tropicanna Cherry #8 is the answer. Pick up a nug, squeeze it, and take a deep sniff. You'll see this strain from Grown Rogue can't fully appreciated any other way.\nIt starts with the nose. Even the casual toker can smell that strong presentation of cherries over a bright twist of tangerine. More sophisticated palates will pick out a sweet floral scent—like chamomile tea with honey, or maybe a touch of grenadine syrup—and that's only the beginning.\nTropicanna Cherry #8 tastes like cherry and fruit. You can expect a burst of citrus on the exhale, certain to ensure that you're going to take more than one hit. The effects kick in as soon as you exhale that second puff. Tropicanna Cherry #8 starts in with a short-lived but very stimulating head high. It's the perfect window of opportunity to decide where you want to ride out the soothing body high. Next thing you know, your eyes will relax, your shoulders will roll back, and you'll be enveloped in a blanket of calming relaxation thicker than a Portland November fog.",

Sometimes called Sourdough Kush, this strain is everything we love about weed.\nIt's got a long-lasting high, enough to keep you going the whole rest of the night.

If you can handle the hit, it will boost you into new plateaus of creativity and insight, stimulating your mind to forge new connections never before conceived.\n\nThis soaring head high is accompanied by a stimulating and sometimes arousing body high that’s great for physical activity. It’s good for kinetic art like sculpture or music, for physical exercise like hot yoga, or for enhancing intimacy. While it’s great for getting out, it’s also an experience of its own, so don’t feel bad if you just want to lie down for a while.\n\nOnce you're good and up there, staring at these frosted multichromatic nuggets is a trip unto itself.

Eugreen Farms prioritizes flavor over everything, and that's the best part about Orange Oreoz—it delivers. Buckle in for a taste that's so realistic you'll forget you just took a hit and not a bite of a delicious creme-filled cookie.\nThis sativa-leaning hybrid was developed by crossing Tropicana Cookies with a hybrid of GMO and Oreoz. GMO and Oreoz double down on that campfire s'mores flavor associated with Oreoz and that deep sense of peace and calm you get from GMO. Tropicana Cookies brings that brighter citrus flavor to mingle with the cookies, adding an undeniably orange tint to the bouquet.\nDo not underestimate this strain! Everything in Orange Oreoz's heritage is a highly potent phenotype from its respective family. Fortunately, there's enough sedative relaxation to keep its sativa-leaning roots from making you fidgety and uncomfortable, while that extra boost of energy from Tropicana Cookies prevents the indica-leaning effects of the other two parents from dragging you into the couch for the rest of the day. For flavor enthusiasts with high tolerance, Oreo Cookiez hits the spot.",

      "description": "Around here, we love a good breakfast strain, and Blueberry French Toast is about as in-your-face delicious as anyone could hope for. One puff, and you'll feel just like you're sitting at the back table of an Amsterdam café, warming your toes by the fire while you watch snow flurries through the window. \n\nBlueberry French Toast has a smooth, creamy taste and an unmistakably blueberry flavor. If you guessed Blue Dream was part of its heritage, take another hit—you've earned it! It's slightly toastier on the exhale, with a pronounced flavor of earthiness and char that lingers in the air like a proper patisserie. Make sure you corner the bowl if you're smoking from a pipe to preserve that potpourri-like balance of sweet and savory.\n\nThis is a wake-and-bake, get-up-and-go strain, which you'll know right from the get-go. Blueberry French Toast announces its presence with a pleasant tingling sensation right in your cheekbones, drawing up a smile of anticipation. It's great for planning your ski runs, mapping the day's hike, or figuring out which item on your to-do list needs to be started first, and it pairs well with friends—the bester, the better.\f",

Look closely, and you'll see rich green textures laced with hues of purple and overlapping light orange hairs. \n\nIt's a cross between Carbon Fiber and Gushers, which you can smell as soon as you pop open the bag. Carbon Candy has an undeniably sweet aroma with a touch of grape tang that will tickle your appetite before you even smoke it. Equally tasty in a joint or a blunt, the flavor turns savory when you light it up, full of herbs and spice.\n\nThis is a strain for taking things down a notch. Whether you're coming home from a hectic day of work or your household chores have reached such an unmanageable degree that you're freaking out just trying to figure out where to start, Carbon Candy will buy you a couple hours of pure chill to sort out the signal from the noise.

This is a meticulously grown and cared for small batch hybrid produced by Coastal Cultivation that combines the stellar genetics of Orange Cookies, Face Off OG, and Lotus. Let us break that down for you so you know what to expect.\nAs you can tell from the test results, Blues OG is one hell of a potent strain. 30% THC in a flower is nothing to sneeze at, so make sure you know your limits before you pack a full bowl. It's also packed full of flavor. That's like Coastal Cultivation's whole thing—they're after extraordinary tastes and flavorful experiences—they create phenotypes with robust flavor profiles, and Blues OG does not disappoint. It tastes fresh and clean, bursting with citrus berry flavors over a distinctly skunky musk.\nBlues OG is a great bedtime strain. It has an ethereal quality that will start to blur the boundaries before fantasy and reality, perfect for letting your mind wander as you drift off. You'll also notice a heavy, long-lasting body high that will make you want to wrap yourself up in all the blankets and snooze until you start smelling breakfast.\f\f",

      "description": "Something we love about all LOWD's flower is that it always lives up to its name. Spilt Paint is loud, filling your space with its aroma as soon as you pop open the pouch. Take a moment to just inhale the scent before you even look at the bud—it's fruity, nutty, and uniquely sweet. The flower isn't bad to look at either. Each nug is bright and fluffy, with a sparkly dusting of trichomes like still-falling snow on a tree branch.\nOf course, the journey doesn't stop there. Spilt Paint was born from the combination of two spectacular strains—Georgia Pie and Runtz. Georgia Pie gives the Spilt Paint high a feeling of enchantment, like suddenly anything is possible, and that's great for getting carried away with brand new harebrained schemes. One reason it's called \"Spilt Paint\" is you won't mind getting a little messy with whatever work of creativity currently occupying your space as you waltz with your muse.\nThen there's Runtz, which gives you the stamina to keep dancing long into the night. It brings the motivation to meet Georgia Pie's inspiration and gives Spilt Paint that extra \"oomph\" to move you from just thinking about something to actually doing it.\f",

      "description": "Toe Jam is a hot new phenotype from LOWD that does not sound nearly as appealing as it hits. While some varieties are bred from Cheese and DJ Short Flo—a decidedly stinkier strain with the same name—this one is bred from Gelato 41 and Undertow. Gelato 41 leans slightly sativa while Undertow leans indica, and when they get together, the combination is tasty, aromatic, and sure to pull you under.\nUnlike Cheese strains, you can put this bud right up to your nose and inhale deeply. A bright bouquet of oranges and mint rise to the surface, underscored by rich notes of earth, pine, and a little bit of diesel. The frosted pale green buds have some subtle purple accents if you break them apart to look inside, and we recommend using a kief-catching grinder to make sure you don't lose any of those crystalized trichomes in the process.\nToe Jam hits your brain like a late-stage Childish Gambino album—it might seem disorienting at first, but you quickly relax into the soothing power of its tasty grooves. This is a sociable high worth sharing with a couple close friends, or a rejuvenating introspective journey if you're smoking on your own tonight.\f",

You can thank β-caryophyllene for clearing out your sinuses. The second reason is that this strain will make you rev up your engine. You'll want to throw open your blinds, your windows, maybe even your door and dance right out into the street.\n\nMaybe you've been feeling down lately, a little lazy, or just plain bored, but if you're looking for a way to face your problems head-on, Sour Diesel is just the fuel to help you get there. Though technically only a sativa-dominant hybrid, this strain feels like a landrace sativa with its speedy cerebral head high. This particular phenotype is a little more on the chill side with a solid showing from β-myrcene, but it's still predominantly a pick-me-up strain.\n\nDr. Jolly's uses a subcritical extraction process to preserve as much of the plant's original entourage effect as possible.

      "description": "Also known as \"Sour Cherry,\" Sour Cherries is another delectable varietal from Dr. Jolly's. While the flower might make you pucker, this Nug Run is extracted exclusively from dried and cured buds, so some of the sour has worn off. Not the terpenes, though, and you can tell from its THC content that this strain hits hard.\n\nIt's great if you can roll with it. Sour Cherries starts with a strong, calming body buzz that settles in like a weighted blanket draped across your chest. As you start to sink physically, the head high creeps up on you with what can best be described as pleasant amnesia. Whatever might have been bothering you before you took a hit will quickly dissolve as your mood floats away, detached from the burdens of reality.\n\nSour Cherries is a good fit for experienced users who are less likely to encounter the more undesirable side effects like red eyes or dry mouth. It might be too much for people who are new to concentrates, or who have low tolerance, but if the main thing you like about cannabis is that it helps you get to sleep, then this may be the perfect strain regardless of all that.",

It has a buzzy physical high that can be both invigorating and somewhat stimulating, which is good for explorations of an altogether different nature.

This pungent-smelling indica expresses a duality of effects: heavy body effects that crush insomnia and pain coupled with an invigorating cerebral buzz. A 7 or 8 week flowering time is all Garlic Bud needs to reach full maturation, finishing with sizeable yields.",

Point Break is an excellent choice for winding down with a double feature in your living room or partaking in your favorite rejuvenation exercise.\n\nIt smells sweet and sour at the same time, like the sunny beaches of Santa Monica. Point Break has notes of tangerine over a bed of woody pine and fresh earth. It delivers an effect that is lifted and euphoric at the same time, dispelling any cloudy thoughts from your mind.\n\nAfter it's had the chance to lift you up, Point Break settles you back down with a heavy body high full of stoney relaxation. If you've never seen \"Point Break”, this would be a great time to pop in the DVD. Just make sure to follow it up with “Bad Boyz II”, or you'll be missing out on some right proper action. Oh, and it also pairs well with surfing, so long as you're indulging after you hit the waves—you're going to need your reaction time intact if you want to actually catch any. ",

That's the nice thing about these nug run concentrates from Dr. Jolly's—they take the time to really cure the buds so the flavors have the chance to marinate. Orange Chemdawg is an indica-leaning hybrid with powerful effects and an equally potent flavor.\n\nOrange Chemdawg has a spicy taste with strong notes of diesel fuel and a fruity citrus undertone that gives it that extra special something you'll really taste on the exhale. Be forewarned—the smell is so pungent that everyone around will know exactly what you're up to. This is not a stealth strain!\n\nAs loud as it is, Orange Chemdawg is great for when you're feeling down, offering a cerebral high that sparks creativity and positive well-being. It comes complete with a stony body high, so if you take two hits it will assuage any lingering anxieties that might be keeping you up at night. Orange Chemdawg is also great for intimate conversations with friends you wish you knew better. It might hit hard, but that can help you get on the same level as each other to really dig in.

      "strainDescription": "Chemdawg, officially named \"Chemdog,\" is a hybrid marijuana strain grown and spread by the breeder Chemdog since 1991. In a Leafly interview, Chemdog relates how Chemdog came from what was thought to be Northern California bag seed, via a Colorado Grateful Dead concert. Chem 91, Chem 4, and Chem Sis are all variations on Chemdog. The original name Chemdog came from two names for the same bud \"Chem\" and \"Dog bud.\" Chemdog evolved into the variation 'Chemdawg' over time and distance as other growers and breeders propagated it, with the latter name becoming more dominant. Leafly customers tell us Chemdawg effects include feeling euphoric, uplifted, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose Chemdawg when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. Chemdog is a staple strain in cannabis and may be a source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdog is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, you’ll be able to smell this strain from a mile away. Cannabis newbies be warned: Chemdog tends to be very potent. Consumers can expect to have a cerebral experience, coupled with a strong heavy-bodied feeling. ",

Still, everything we love about it is here. Just like a real wedding, it doesn't matter much where it comes from, so long as everyone's happy.\n\nWedding Cake has a rich flavor, full of wood and hops that finishes with a hint of flowers and tang. It's perfect for keeping your cool whether you're out at a bachelorette party or staying inside. \n\nOnce the high sets in, you'll find yourself relaxed, sleepy, and a little hungry. This is a good afterparty strain, for winding down when you're not quite ready to pack it all the way in for the night. Its sativa parents contribute a little bit of creativity and euphoria, so you'll still have energy enough to make new friends while reconnecting with the old.

      "description": "The reason truffles are considered a delicacy isn't because of the way they taste on their own or how they allegedly bring out the underlying flavors of a dish by providing a boring one-dimensional flavor as a backdrop—it's because they're impossible to cultivate, requiring specially-trained pigs to sniff them out beneath the tree roots under which they grow. And there is none more valuable, more delectable, more sought-after than the white truffle, which gives this stain its name.\n\nWhite Truffle is named for two things: its flavor, and the frosting of trichomes that makes its round nugs look like big puffy truffles. Sauce on the Rocks is one of Dr. Jolly's terpier extracts, and the earthy scent of skunk and garlic certainly is reminiscent of the real deal—but that's not why we like it.\n\nThe best thing about White Truffle is how it makes you feel. It starts with a euphoric, cerebral head rush that will inject some spontaneity into your day, giving you new exciting ideas for what to do next. While your mind is distracted, your body will start to sink into a peaceful and relaxing stone that will keep you on that track.",

It's a legendary hybrid that earned its reputation back in the prohibition era when every cultivar had to defend its place under the grow light. The term \"perfectly balanced\" gets thrown around a lot with hybrids, but in this case, it's true—Original Glue is as close as you can get to the perfect hybrid.\n\nAside from its potency, this is a great strain for a first-time dabber. The high starts with a pleasant lifting sensation that opens your mind to the positive possibilities that surround you, then gives way to the best kind of body high that loosens you up and sticks you to whatever surface you might be sitting on. It’s got a light, woody flavor with hints of pine and juniper, so it shouldn’t lead to much coughing at all.\n\nOriginal Glue is named for the way it glues you to the couch, so we recommend it for activities where you wouldn’t be likely to get up anyway, such as watching a movie, playing video games, or going for a long soak in a hot tub.",

GMO gives it a balanced sense of peaceful relaxation that's as easy on your mind as it is on your body, while Georgia Pie stimulates your imagination and inspires the sort of creative breakthroughs that can really reinvigorate your practice.\nWhen it comes to the flavor, Georgia GMO hits all the notes of a down-south highway diner—it's pungent with an aroma of spice and coffee, but it has a smooth doughy taste with a hint of cherry rhubarb pie. At 77% THC, it's not as potent as some of our other concentrates, but we actually like it that way. When a concentrate is too strong, it can actually interfere with the creative process.\f",

It’s good for kinetic art like sculpture or music, for physical exercise like hot yoga, or for enhancing intimacy. While it’s great for getting out, it’s also an experience of its own, so don’t feel bad if you just want to lie down for a while.\n\nApples & Bananas is also one of the tastier concentrates on the market.

      "description": "As fun as it is to get completely blitzed, sometimes you want a high that still leaves you able to function, something that's calming and relaxing, but won't knock you out. RS-11 is great for days when you have things to do, but you want to be cool about it—the very definition of a wake-and-bake strain.\n\nThis Live Budder from Echo Electuary is a spreadable paste that's super easy to work with. Dab a little RS-11 into your banger, and your nose will start to smile with the extra fruity flavor floating up into your nostrils. It smells like the gelato cooler at your favorite ice cream parlor, full of cherry, berry, and just a hint of frosty pine. \n\nRS-11 starts with a stimulating high that promotes alertness and congeniality, which is ideal for knocking out your to-do list. That burst of positive productivity is followed by a deeply penetrating body high that is almost perfectly timed for you to take a well-deserved break after all that work, or maybe even kick off for the rest of the day. Mind the drop though—once your butt hits the couch, RS-11 will keep it there until the high wears off.",

RS-11 was bred by Deo Farms of Oakland, CA, the maker of Zoap. RS-11 was selected by Wizard Trees of LA, along with RS-54. In 2023, many cultivators grow RS-11 across the US. RS-11 is more relaxing than energizing. Consumers who have smoked this strain report feeling calm, and sedated, but still mentally alert. The flavor profile is extra fruity with hints of sour citrus. RS11 flower provides a smooth smoke and a lingering sweet and spicy aroma. Medical marijuana patients say they smoke this strain when experiencing mild pain.",

      "description": "Tropical flavors are all the rage for the hotter months, and there is no better way to get your fix than these guava flavored edibles by Good Tide. A sub-brand of Wyld, Good Tide is all about working toward a sustainable future with vegan gummies and a compostable packaging, so you can be sure you are doing your part to help protect the environment. \n\nThe flavor is great because it is made with real guava fruit, so you don’t have to deal with any artificial flavoring. Good Tide also makes their edibles with solventless hash rosin, so they really utilize the naturally occurring terpenes and minor cannabinoids. The flavors combined create an overly delicious and rounded experience.  \n\nIf the flavor isn’t enough to persuade you to give these new tropical edibles a shot, then the high certainly will. Like most edibles, you only need a 10 mg serving to start to feel the effects, but if you are a more seasoned smoker you can always take more; though we recommend waiting the required time first. Once the gummies hit the high will have you feeling calm, happy, and very relaxed. \n\nPersonally, we feel like these tropical gummies are the perfect addition to sitting poolside on a nice, sunny day. Though you don’t need the sun, or a pool, to have a great day and an even better high. All you really need is the right attitude, maybe even a few friends to share with, and some delicious gummies.",

Make ‘em with cocoa and you’ve got delectable chocolate in the mix, make ‘em with peanut butter and you’ve got something savory. Some people like to use the fruity variety for a lighter flavor, while others prefer the original taste to go heavy on the marshmallow.\n\nRegardless of your flavor preference, Better Edibles has you covered with this Cannacrispy treat. Whether you’re looking at Original, Chocolate, Fruity, Peanut Butter, or Cookies and Cream, their focus is on making sure what you’re about to eat is so delicious you won’t even taste the cannabis that went into making them. \n\nBut watch out—they’re potent! Most edibles start you out with a dose of about 5mg, but these babies break down into 10mg cubes when you split them along the scored lines. That makes them perfect for splitting with your friends when you’ve all got high tolerance, or if you’ve got a long weekend coming up and you want to stay blazed without blowing smoke.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a high that’s sleepy and relaxed, or something that’s more lifted and energetic, Cannacrispy has the right bar for your. Each of their flavors comes in a Sativa, Hybrid, and Indica variety so you’re not locked into specific effects just because you prefer a certain flavor.\n",

It's a perfectly customizable edible, scored for easy dosage into twenty 5mg squares. Just starting out? One teeny tiny square will do—and there's nineteen more where that came from. Got high tolerance? You might be able to break off three or four. Ask your doctor if you should take any more.\n\nWhatever your pleasure, these gummies are vegan and gluten-free, safe to be enjoyed by anyone above the legal age of consumption. They're made with real Strawberry terpenes for an authentic mouthwatering flavor, and the cannabis extract is formulated for consistency and effect. LTRMN makes their Strawberry Beaucoup from a choice sativa strain that imbues it with the get-up-and-go you need to stay active. It's bursting with flavor, sustained energy, and a lasting high, without making you feel anxious or paranoid.",

Everybody likes Purple Punch though, and its aroma announces its presence like a punch to the face. This choice extract from Select Elite perfectly preserves every note of every flavor from the original flower so you can appreciate the whole spectrum of what this strain has to offer.\n\nIt’s a one-two hit when you vape it too. The effects start behind the eyes with a warm inflating euphoria. As you rise to meet a higher state of serenity, the second punch turns your arms and legs into sandbags. Purple Punch is for mellowing out and decompressing, both mentally and physically.\n\nIf you can stay awake for it, Purple Punch acts as a mood elevator to ease stress and relieve tension. It has anti-inflammatory properties that might help with discomfort as well. We think it’s a perfect cart for a long afternoon spent soaking up the sun or whenever a nap would be a welcome option.\f",

Select's distillate extraction process reintroduces strain-specific terpenes to the cannabinols so you get pure, clean vapor with all the authentic flavor profile of the original. Berry Gelato is one of the more delectable varietals out there, so you'll definitely appreciate the fact that this one comes in a cartridge.\nBerry Gelato is a cross between Thin Mint GSC and Blueberry, so right off the bat you know it's going to be fruity as all hell with some uncanny earthiness to keep it grounded. It's too bad it's so potent, because it tastes so good you'll want to hit it over and over again. But don't. It's nearly 84% THC, which is more than enough for even the most experienced consumer.\nIf you've got the tolerance for it, Berry Gelato offers a clear-headed, functional high that borders the realm of psychedelic while keeping you chilled to the max. If you've got less tolerance and/or experience, you may find yourself simply sinking slowly into the couch, coming to hours later after the weed nap has lifted from your mind.",

This strain features aromatic fruity flavors with earthy undertones. The high THC content of Berry Gelato (21% THC) makes it an ideal strain for experienced cannabis consumers. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with anxiety and stress. Growers say Berry Gelato has light to dark green foliage with thick orange hairs.

The terpene profile is a perfect mixture of Cherry Pie’s musky, sweet cherry undertones and Tangie’s loud tropical flavors. There are also notes of pine, mango, and passionfruit candy. The indica effects hit hard between the eyes and lay into the body with each hit. Forbidden Fruit’s deep physical relaxation and mental stoniness make it perfect for dulling minor physical discomfort and discarding stress. ",

Bedtime isn’t the only time aches and pains cause discomfort, but Granddaddy Purps is the all-time champion for making them go away.\n\nIt’s like a deep-tissue muscle massage for your brain that also seeps into your joints and tendons for supreme relief. Granddaddy Purps is one of the most popular Indica strains on the west coast for a reason. The result of a cross between Big Bud and Purple Urkle, it’s got a sweet grape flavor with notes of pungent spice. Granddaddy Purps hits a bit harsh, so we recommend going slow with small tokes until you get a feel for it. Then, kick back as the high washes over you—the very definition of “chillax.”\n\nSelect Cliq Pods are triple-sealed to prevent leakage and the transparent reservoir lets you see how much you have left. They're designed to work exclusively with Select's Cliq Battery. ",

      "description": "Wait, they're naming strains after highways now? What does that even mean? I-95 is the interstate that runs all the way up and down the east coast from Miami to New Brunswick. That's a twenty-eight hour drive, if you and some friends were crazy enough to try it all in one go, but is there anything more fun to do with your crew than taking a spontaneous cross-country road trip?\n\nWell, maybe staying on the best coast and hitting this live resin from Drops. I-95 is an inspiring and motivating strain that would have you looking for your keys to go put another five on it if you didn't know better. It's got a skunky, pungent taste that's bound to make you cough with that diesely sour tinge to it that's reminiscent of the New Jersey Turnpike. \n\nI-95 is a creeper, too. Its slow momentum means that by the time you're high enough to start coming up with your most harebrained ideas, you'll also notice a deep physical relaxation that will remind you there's no place you'd rather be than here, no time you'd rather be than now, and no one you'd rather be than you.",

      "description": "Moby Jack is as elusive as the great white whale responsible for half of its namesake. Some say it doesn't even exist, yet here we have it, meticulously preserved in this Live Distillate by Buddies. Moby Jack is cagey about its pedigree, but it's likely to be a cross between Moby Dick and Jack Herer, elevating the complementary attributes of both sativa-heavy hybrids.\n\nWhile Moby Jack has a fairly high concentration of THC, it's really the cannabichromene and cannabigerol that take it to the next level. CBC is more effective at reducing anxiety than CBD, and CBG enhances the effects of THC by reducing inflammation, promoting blood flow. The result is an experience that is both undeniably uplifting and inexplicably reassuring. Moby Jack is an inspiration in its own right, tempering the mania of Jack Herer with a laid back sort of vibe.\n\nEven the taste is invigorating. It hits rich with earthy notes of nutmeg and tea tree, which might be intense enough to make you cough. The exhale offers its own relieving factors with a sweet, lightly mentholated flavor. Watch the smoke plumes for images of great oceanic mammals, and you'll know it's kicked in.\n",

      "description": "Don't sleep on this hybrid! Buddies has taken all of the calming cool of Kush Mints and combined it with the activating potency of Gary Payton to bring you the best in center-court confidence. Gary Payton strums you up and gets you into the zone whether you're on the court or on the bench, ready to spring into action, and Kush Mints tapers that exuberance with a feeling of calm and composure, leaving you self-assured within the comfort of your own inner self.\n\nGary Payton X Kush Mints has a sweet, minty flavor, encased in an herbal diesel exterior that is invigorating in its own right. While the flower might be loud, this Live Distillate dissipates quickly, so it's good for a discrete toke when you need it.\n\nThe high is fast, hard-hitting, and long-lasting. It brings on an immediate hit of euphoria and giggles that translate to increased energy, without overdoing it. After the initial rush, you'll notice a warming spinal tingle that permeates your entire body with a deep-seated sense of relaxation. This combination will empower you with an experience of lifted serenity, the essence of getting in the zone and then going with the flow.",

It's got a peculiar flavor—cheesy and minty at the same time with a little bit of diesel and citrus in the mix—but it finishes smooth. It's one of the few strains that actually sweetens as you vape it.\n\nWhen it comes to how it makes you feel, Cold Snap will have you snacking like a bear who's about to go into hibernation.

      "description": "Select has really done something neat with Cliq. It is the result of years of research and development with one goal in mind: creating an innovative high-quality vaporizer that is durable, convenient, and comfortable. Using a rechargeable battery and interchangeable Pods, Cliq delivers a vape with unparalleled refinement.\n\nThis battery has three voltage settings, (2.8, 3.2, and 3.6,) which allow you to dial in the perfect temperature. Low voltage lets you taste all the delicious terpenes contained within Select’s Elite oils while higher voltages produce voluminous clouds of vapor. We recommend keeping it on low or medium to get the full range of flavor. The battery is encased in an extruded stainless steel shell for durability and coated in a matte-finish automotive grade paint for a distinctive feel.\n\nIt charges with USB-C so you don’t have to keep up with extra cables. For convenience and security, Cliq Pods connect to the battery with high powered magnets that give it that signature “click” when it all comes together. The best part is that it’s breath-activated so there’s no risk of it coming on in your pocket or bag and wasting oil.\n\nThis battery is free with the purchase of at least one Select Cliq Pod. One battery per order, and or customer while supplies last.\n\nHow to use the Select Cliq Battery\n\nYour Cliq battery comes with a USB to USB-C charging cable that plugs into a port at the bottom. While your battery might already have some juice when you get it, we recommend charging it until the indicator light turns green for best results.\n\nOnce charged, all you have to do is insert your Cliq Pod into the appropriate slot on top of the battery. Magnets will bring the two parts together with a satisfying click and the light on the front will light up with the color of your current voltage setting—blue, yellow, or green.\n\nThere’s a single button that’s used to change the voltage setting or preheat the coil.\n\nClick the button three times to change voltage settings, and it will cycle between 2.8v (blue), 3.2v (yellow), and 3.6v (green).\nClick the button two times and it will preheat the coil to help dislodge any air bubbles that may still be attached to the cotton. This is usually only necessary during cold weather or during extended exposure to the outdoors.\nTo hit a Cliq vaporizer, just put it to your mouth and inhale. You should see the indicator light up blue, yellow, or green (depending on your setting) for up to five seconds of continuous draw. After five seconds, the light will blink several times and then fall dim. The Cliq Battery has this safety feature to prevent overheating, which is part of what makes this design so safe.",
