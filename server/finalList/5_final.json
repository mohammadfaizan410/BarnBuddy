      "description": "Gush Mints is an indica dominant hybrid strain (70% indica/30% sativa) created through crossing the classic Kush Mints X (F1 Durbs X Gushers) strains. If you're after an amazing flavor with a sleepy, nighttime high, Gush Mints is the perfect indica for you. Like its parent strains, Gush Mints packs a sweet and sugary berry cherry flavor with a punch of sour citrus and tangy menthol that intensifies the more that you toke. The aroma is just as heavy, with a sharp menthol overtone accented by spicy cheesy diesel and sweet fruity cherries. The Gush Mints high will settle in a few minutes after your final exhale, hitting your brain with a lifted sense of pure euphoria that's accompanied by a heavy happiness that leaves no room for negative or racing thoughts. A soothing body high comes next, washing over your physical form and leaving you feeling fully numb and sedated from head to toe. Combined with its high 19-20% average THC level, these effects make Gush Mints a great choice for treating conditions such as appetite loss or nausea, chronic pain, depression, chronic stress and insomnia. This bud has dense and conical dusty green nugs with deep purple undertones, lots of leaves and thin orange hairs coated with tiny, purple-tinted white crystal trichomes.",

      "description": "Mendo Breath is a super rare indica dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the classic OG Kush Breath with the rare Mendo Montage strain. This hard to find bud brings on the potency, with a THC level that bottoms out at about 19-20% on average and dazzling full bodied effects. Mendo Breath comes on pretty quickly after your first few hits, filling your mind and body with a happy tingly effect. This tingle quickly turns into a full on buzz, washing over you physically and pulling you down into a heavy couch-locked body high. As you lose your physical form to happy sedation, your mind will lift into a state of hazy euphoria that leaves you unable to focus and pretty sleepy at times. Thanks to these nighttime effects and its high THC level, Mendo Breath is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, inflammation, muscle spasms or cramps, and chronic stress. This bud has a sweet vanilla caramel candy flavor and a fresh earthy aroma to match. Mendo Breath buds have lumpy round minty green nugs with furry orange hairs and a thick frosty coating of tiny bright white crystal trichomes.",

Growers say Mendo Breath comes in dense, frosty buds and has an average flowering time of 60 days. ",

Mint Cake effects include relaxation and euphoria, with a smaller percentage of people reporting that it makes them feel tingly. Medical marijuana patients tell us they choose this strain for dealing with symptoms associated with pain, depression, and inflammation. Mint Cake is 21% THC and the effects may be overwhelming to inexperienced cannabis consumers. The dominant terpene in this strain is Limonene. The origins of Mint Cake are unknown.",

Zoap can have sweet, floral, soap flavor with some earthy undertones. Medical marijuana patients may enjoy Zoap to help with chronic pain or stress, depression, and nausea. Zoap started with packs of OZ Kush seeds from Dying Breed (Eddy OG x Z). Two of Deo's selections of OZ Kush became his Pink Guava. Then Deo crossed his Pink Guava to Sunset Sherbert and started the \"RS\" line. \"RS\" is short for Rainbow Sherbert. LA grower Wizard Trees selected the RS#11 and RS#54. Deo took the RS#16 and bred it back with RS to make Zoap.",

      "description": "Lemon Meringue, not to be confused with the like-named “Lemon Meringue Pie,” and also known as \"Lemon Mirengue\", is a sativa dominant hybrid strain (70% sativa/30% indica) created through crossing the infamous Lemon Skunk X Cookies ‘N Cream strains. Named for its delectable lemony flavor, Lemon Meringue brings on the creamy delicious tastes alongside a focused and long-lasting high that will have you feeling lifted for hours on end before fading away into a sleepy comedown. You'll feel a cerebral onset a few minutes after your final toke, filling you with a sense of focus and creative energy that soon fades into a super sedative comedown that almost always ends in sleep. Thanks to these effects and its high 18-22% average THC level, Lemon Meringue is often chosen to treat those suffering from conditions such as chronic fatigue, depression, chronic stress, insomnia, chronic pain and headaches or migraines. Lemon Meringue has a delicious nutty fruity flavor with a light creamy lemon exhale. The aroma is earthy and spicy with a sweet lemony overtone that turns pungent and skunky as the nugs are broken apart and burned. Lemon Meringue buds have small airy minty green nugs with yellow-orange hairs and a thick blanketed coating of tiny golden white crystal trichomes.",

      "description": "Moonshine Haze is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain created as a cross between the hugely popular Nevil's Wreck X Amnesia Haze strains. Like real moonshine, this bud has overpowering effects powered by a high THC level of up to 20% that can leave you in an almost drunken stupor, which is likely why it was the 2011 winner for Best Sativa at the High Times' Cannabis Cup. The high starts with an almost immediate energy boost that leaves you with insanely enhanced sensory perception and awareness of what is going on around you. You'll also be hit with a relaxing effect that leaves you serene and at peace with an uplifted happy sensation. These effects can become slightly psychoactive at times and can leave you spacey and distant if you smoke too much at once. Because of these powerful effects, Moonshine Haze is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, fatigue, mild to moderate cases of depression, and chronic stress. This bud has an insanely delicious aroma of fresh floral haze with a fruity citrus hint and a taste of sweet citrus and grapefruit with an intensely crisp haze aftertaste upon exhale. Moonshine Haze buds have medium-sized spade-shaped bright neon green nugs with bright fiery orange hairs and a thick layer of sandy white crystal trichomes.",

Dutch Treat has THC levels reaching 18-25%, so it's strong but not aggressively so. It smells like eucalyptus and has a sweet, earthy pine flavor. The head high is intensely euphoric and upbeat, while the body high is deeply relaxed. Dutch Treat works well on anxiety and pain, and it's also helpful with insomnia. This strain is recommended for ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and arthritis. Adverse effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Outside Holland, Dutch Treat is most popular in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest United States. It's a descendant of Northern Lights, a famed indica; skunk, a potent hybrid; and Haze, one of the most popular sativas of all time. That mixed but esteemed heritage makes Dutch Treat a fun, effective treatment for both mental and physical suffering. As a heavy indica, this strain can be a bit hard to find, but it's common enough in places where marijuana is legal.",

Bred by GG Strains LLC, Gorilla Glue features flavors like pungent, pine, and earthy. The dominant terpene of this strain is caryophyllene. The average price of Gorilla Glue typically ranges from $10-$15 per gram.

A true A-List cannabis strain, Blueberry’s legendary status soared to new heights after claiming the High Times’ Cannabis Cup 2000 for Best indica. The long history of the strain goes back to the late 1970s when American breeder DJ Short was working with a variety of exotic landrace strains. However, throughout the decades of Blueberry’s cultivation, the genetics have been passed around, due in large part to DJ Short working with multiple seed banks and breeders. The sweet flavors of fresh blueberries combine with relaxing effects to produce a long-lasting sense of euphoria. Many consumers utilize the effects of Blueberry to help contend with pain and stress, while connoisseurs and growers admire the strain for its colorful hues and high THC content.",

      "description": "Blackberry is a hybrid strain with a perfect blend of indica and sativa breeds that create an amazing 20% THC content. The strain is mouthwatering to say the least. Not only are the buds beautiful, but they are scrumptious at the same time. The buds are not as dense as any other strain you may have already come across, but they are brilliantly bred to produce hues of purple covered with white crystals and bright orange hairs. The aroma is intoxicating, as it is quite fruity with a hint of earth. There is a pretty good reason why the strain is referred to as Blackberry. It tastes amazing and smooth just like a bowl of fruit. If you are looking for a daytime strain, you should not look any further. Blackberry offers a body and cerebral high that will overwhelm you in no time. Furthermore, you will feel more energetic and talkative all the while feeling incredibly social. On the other hand, Blackberry is equally effective at treating several medical conditions including stress, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, due to its body numbing effects, it is perfect for patients suffering from chronic aches and pain as well.",

The Golden Pineapple proves to be very effective both in the short run and in the long run regardless of the problem you may be facing. The Golden Pineapple is a very popular hybrid that is considered to be a cross between the Pineapple Kush and the Golden Goat. This particular strain naturally has a fruity and a very tropical flavor and aroma which are similar to that of a sour pineapple. Apart from its great taste, this strain is quite effective at battling stress, anxiety and depression. This particular strain also provides you with a good amount of energy, allowing you to seize the day. This is a good strain to smoke especially when you have a long and hard day in front of you. However, the only thing to look out for is the fact that if you take it in larger doses you can find it hard to focus on whatever you will be doing that day.",

It is an excellent choice for stress relief, pain management, and insomnia. The top flavors and aromas of Skywalker are earthy, woody, and spicy, with hints of sweetness and fruitiness. The dominant terpene in Skywalker is caryophyllene, which has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The Skywalker weed strain has become popular among cannabis enthusiasts, and many people wonder if it has any connection to the Star Wars franchise. While the strain's name likely refers to the characters in the Star Wars universe, there is no official connection between the two. However, it's interesting to note that both the strain and the franchise are widely known and loved, and they share a name that adds to their mystique and popularity. So, while you won't find Luke Skywalker smoking Skywalker weed in any of the Star Wars movies, it's still fun to speculate about the potential connection between the two. ",

A great well-balanced hybrid with a slight sativa lean, Grapealicious is the perfect bud for anyone who’s after a relaxing high that will stimulate mind and body before helping both to settle down. The high comes with a with a cerebral boost of euphoria a few minutes after your final toke, filling your brain with an expansive happy sense. A relaxing body buzz accompanies this heady lift, helping to keep your physical form anchored as your mind flies higher and higher. This combination does quickly turn sedative and heady, which will leave you giggling and unfocused before you finally fade away into a long and peaceful sleep. With these effects and its moderate 12-19% average THC level, Grapealicious is often chosen to treat conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic pain, muscle spasms or cramps and appetite loss or nausea. This bud has a sweet and fruity berry grape flavor with a lightly sour and kushy exhale. The aroma is of spicy fruity grapes, sweet berries and a kushy spicy overtone that intensifies the more that you toke. Grapealicious buds have fat and rounded olive green nugs with dark purple undertones, deep red-orange hairs and a coating of frosty, purple-tinted white crystal trichomes.",
