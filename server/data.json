Both customers and vendors alike can’t get enough of the experience and premium product selection available at all three Top Crop locations throughout Oregon. While our main jam is providing the best value on the most expansive selection of flower, concentrates, carts and edibles around, we are about a whole lot more than helping folks get high. It’s our goal to help customers learn more about this incredible plant and how it works within our bodies. We’re here to help educate enthusiasts, advance the industry as a whole, and destigmatize—and normalize—cannabis use in all of its forms.",

Many of our competitors prioritize volume thus running large operations which require a regular pesticide regiment. Here, we're different! We care about the medicinal quality of our plants above all else. We've found the best way to maximize the medicinal properties of cannabis is to keep grow rooms small so that each plant gets the individual attention it needs. We've always prioritized quality above all else, and that will never change. Montana Kush is locally owned and operated in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. We live in a place that's perfect and pristine, and we plan on keeping it that way. We are both stewards of the land and protectors of our environment. These values are reflected in the way that we run our business and plan for the future. We are also exceptionally proud that we employ local residents throughout the state of Montana. Our business would be nothing without our team, and we can't emphasize how fundamental they are in everything we do.So next time you're in the shop be sure to hug the budtender!",

Lori is the cannabis “provider” listed under the Montana legal cannabis providers. Linda is the grower for Lori’s patients. Between the two of them, and their dedicated employees, Big Sky Herbals & Edibles runs smoothly to provide our patients with the cleanest products available. Lori excels as the store manager and bud tender. With her gregarious personality and willingness to listen she works closely with each patient to better understand their needs. By offering 16 different varieties of flower the inventory encompasses the gamut of healing properties. She can direct patients to a particular strain with her detailed understanding of terpenes and how they can assist a patient in choosing a strain. With such a variety of flower we also are able to offer a huge variety of products from concentrates like Diamond & Shatter to our Edible selections to healing salves and tinctures. Linda works hard making sure the cultivation of each strain we offer is done in the cleanest, most eco-friendly and organic way possible. Her time is dedicated to ensuring each strain is tended personally with their own idiosyncratic tendencies addressed and appreciated.  From testing the water seasonally to only hand spraying with organic food-safe oils our flowers flourish from babies to harvest. We love our flowers and refuse to use practices found elsewhere that can impact the final products. Our products have been tested since early 2018 and have NEVER failed.",

Who could have possibly known that their love for flying down Montana mountains on the backs of snowboards would blossom into much more: a successful cannabis business. After seeing an opportunity to make a difference in the city they know and love, the pair decided to break into a new realm and become business partners; thus, Granite Peak was born. \"Whoever said that you shouldn’t go into business with your friends doesn’t have friends like us.\" The best part?

Many of our competitors prioritize volume thus running large operations which require a regular pesticide regiment. Here, we're different! We care about the medicinal quality of our plants above all else. We've found the best way to maximize the medicinal properties of cannabis is to keep grow rooms small so that each plant gets the individual attention it needs. We've always prioritized quality above all else, and that will never change. Montana Kush is locally owned and operated in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. We live in a place that's perfect and pristine, and we plan on keeping it that way. We are both stewards of the land and protectors of our environment. These values are reflected in the way that we run our business and plan for the future. We are also exceptionally proud that we employ local residents throughout the state of Montana. Our business would be nothing without our team, and we can't emphasize how fundamental they are in everything we do.So next time you're in the shop be sure to hug the budtender!",

Always ambassadors for ending cannabis prohibition, we salute everyone who got involved and helped pay and pave the way for the legalization movement. HRBD proudly and selflessly joined forces with other like-minded cannabis supporters, working together over the years to lobby the state on behalf of fair laws and access to legal cannabis. What you put into your body matters and how we treat the earth does too, we knew we had to be dedicated to higher quality cannabis and safer growing practices. A leader in sustainable and regenerative growing practices, we are willing to invest in holistic practices from the plants to the products. Chemicals are never sprayed or fed to our plants and organic ingredients used whenever possible. Organic ingredients are used whenever possible in our edibles. Award winning craft cannabis paired with excellent employees is how we are one of the best dispensaries to not only shop but work for. Everyone thrives in a positive, healthy environment and we love investing in our staff so they can be their best!",

    "about": "Our journey into the cannabis industry started in 2012 when we purchased both Mary Janes Headquarters locations in Kelowna and West Kelowna. Our goal was to make the shopping experience a fun, chilled, informative, and comfortable experience. Making the transition from employee to entrepreneur was a huge learning curve and one hell of a ride.  We quickly realized how in-depth the cannabis industry and its connoisseurs were! The science is fascinating, and people are looking for particular ways to indulge – not to mention the accessory manufacturers are getting pretty creative!  There are many different ways of consuming cannabis, after all. Our clients want good recommendations for the best-proven quality sessions, available at different price points that work for every one of them. So we expanded, and expanded, and expanded some more. Basically, we loaded up our Mary Jane's HQ stores with a whole hell of a lot of cool stuff!  Then 2018 came along (AKA legalization), and it made sense that our mega-cannabis accessories stores would sell begin to sell cannabis as well! We were beyond ecstatic (FINALLY!!!!).  But... after reading the copious pages of all the rules, it became pretty evident that we would have to change Mary Jane’s Headquarters too significantly to adhere to all of the rules.  Essentially, transitioning the two stores into cannabis stores no longer made sense (because seriously, who wants to live in a world with no flavoured blunt wraps).  Thus Cheeba Cheeba’s was born. Today we are proud to boast that both Mary Jane’s Headquarters have a Cheeba Cheeba’s Recreational Cannabis store right beside them.  Being in the industry for the past ten years has allowed us to anticipate the needs of our consumers. We know you, and we love you. This is our community! We call West Kelowna our home- our kids go to school here, and we invest back here. It matters to us what you think.  Today, several distinctive characteristics define the Cheeba Cheebas experience: a friendly & relaxed environment paired with knowledgeable staff and a vast selection of products. This combination enables us to ensure the best shopping experience possible while serving up the freshest greens and goodies around!  Come and visit us today and get yourself fixed up good!",

It wasn’t long before they saw a serious need for ethical, professional and compassionate cannabis products and services. Always ambassadors for ending cannabis prohibition, we salute everyone who got involved and helped pay and pave the way for the legalization movement. HRBD proudly and selflessly joined forces with other like-minded cannabis supporters, working together over the years to lobby the state on behalf of fair laws and access to legal cannabis. What you put into your body matters and how we treat the earth does too, we knew we had to be dedicated to higher quality cannabis and safer growing practices. A leader in sustainable and regenerative growing practices, we are willing to invest in holistic practices from the plants to the products. Chemicals are never sprayed or fed to our plants and organic ingredients used whenever possible. Organic ingredients are used whenever possible in our edibles. Award winning craft cannabis paired with excellent employees is how we are one of the best dispensaries to not only shop but work for. Everyone thrives in a positive, healthy environment and we love investing in our staff so they can be their best!",

It's about getting lost in the music, rediscovering our favourite bands, finding new ways to get creative, and building deeper connections with our artistic expression. At Prairie Records, we aim to bring that same sense of discovery to the cannabis retail environment. Curate your cannabis the same way you'd build the perfect playlist - by leading with the vibe you're after. We're here to help you make that happen. Don't see something you're looking for? Ask for a recommendation or inventory check. Find a better price elsewhere, we price match. Our hope is to be the cannabis shop for creative people looking to connect with a community of like minded individuals.",
